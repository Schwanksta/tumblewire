aS'Who broke Haditha?'
p13
aS'Somewhere in between coughing up Matt Cooper\'s emails and canning one of the best investigative teams in the history of American journalism, Time magazine managed to do at least one thing it can brag about. Reporter Tim McGurk and Aparisim Ghosh<em> </em>filed a report on the magazine\'s Web site on <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1174649,00.html">March 19</a> questioning the U.S. military\'s official story on what happened after <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/fallen/dates/2005/nov/19/miguel-terrazas/">Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas</a> was killed when his Humvee struck a roadside bomb outside the Iraqi city of Haditha on Nov. 19, 2005. The official military version back then was that the bomb attack also killed 15 civilians and was followed by an ambush of the U.S. convoy by insurgent gunmen. After engaging in battle, the U.S. forces claimed they killed eight insurgents. As we\'ve learned in the papers these last few days, U.S. forces no longer make those claims.\r\n\r\nMcGurk and Ghosh\'s reporting, based on a videotape provided by an activist group and interviews with residents and officials in Haditha, gave voice to witnesses and survivors there who say that innocent civilians, including a number of women and young children, were massacred in their homes by rampaging American soldiers. The Time story led to an internal military investigation, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/26/AR2006052602069.html">the results of which are now leaking out</a> through the newspapers. <a href="http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1674097.php">Three battalion leaders have already been sacked</a> and the more we learn the uglier it gets. The body count has risen. The military is backing away from previous statements. And it looks like we may see a splash in the next few weeks when it all comes out. Who knows where this one ends up, but right now it looks like it has the potential to hit like another Abu Ghraib. Unfortunately, as it still appears to have been the case with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37679-2004Dec5.html">Pat Tillman</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/07/national/07LYNC.html?ex=1148875200&en=cacbfa5983ac145d&ei=5070">Jessica Lynch</a>, the military\'s media machine seems to have been caught twisting the truth, this time covering up for what Congressman John Murtha (D-PA), an initial supporter of the war who has transformed into a vocal critic, is already denouncing as <a href="http://www.armytimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1808360.php">cold-blooded murder</a>.\r\n\r\nAs constructive as the American reporting has been, it deserves to be mentioned that it might not have happened without a videotape shot the day after the attacks and publicized by an Iraqi branch of Human Rights Watch. I\'ve yet to read any reporting on the cameraman, but it\'s being credited to an unnamed Iraqi journalism student. After all this reporting, I still don\'t know who it was. Has anyone printed the name? I\'d think he or she deserves a little attention, at least within the journalism community. Somebody should <a href="http://bw.watchtan.com/article/54/skype-calling-to-iraq">skype</a> \'em.\r\n\r\nYou can watch an edited version of the video at <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/IraqCoverage/story?id=1743981&page=1">ABCnews.com</a>.'

aS'I strolled over to the Black Cat on 14th Street last Friday night to catch the Swedish folk singer Jose Gonzalez. Thanks to a few good words from the indie press and his inclusion in <a title="click here to watch a high-quality quicktime video" href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviaextcommhigh.html">a popular Sony Bravia advertisement</a>, Jose, whose parents are Argentinean, seems to be making inroads in the States this year. The crowd was larger than I expected and surprisingly keen to see a frumpy European diddle around on his guitar for a most of an hour.\r\n\r\nI dig Jose\'s whisperish, Nick Drake-like sound, but his original compositions often leave me wanting more. I\'m a melody guy. I like my songs sharp with personality and emotion. And most of Jose\'s tunes are, like Drake\'s, brief, elliptical and abstract. That\'s why I think his strongest performances come when he covers other songs. The Sony ad is a remake of <a title="click here to watch the video for the electrolicious original" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZatCZ1YWQeI">a song called "Heartbeats"</a> by another Swedish band, The Knife. And, like his excellent covers of Kylie Minogue\'s "Hand on you Heart" (for a little fun, compare <a title="Kylie" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydL9yJQR8yE">the original video</a> to <a title="Jose" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGSTJSG03ow">the cover</a>) and Bruce <a title="Bruce\'s 1984 original" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihLc3JZSTo8">Springsteen\'s "Born in the USA,"</a> it succeeds wonderfully in bringing out the melancholy and dispair hidden in an otherwise upbeat song.\r\n\r\nThe Springsteen cover is, I think, particularly fitting. Despite its anthemic chorus, "Born in the USA" is hardly a celebration of America. By removing the refrain and unplugging the amplifiers, Jose emphasizes the lyric\'s narrative of a Vietnam vet who returns home alienated from society and scarred by war. <a title="Jose Gonzalez\'s version of " href="http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&ufid=05E933D24196A79C">Click here</a> to download  an .mp3 recording of Jose\'s recent live performance.'

aS'<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I walked down near Ford\'s Theater this afternoon to catch <a title="You can view a trailer by visiting the movie\'s official Web site." href="http://www.thewartapes.com/">The War Tapes</a> at <a title="One of the great things about living a city again is that I have access to one of Landmark Cinema\'s beautiful facilities." href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/Market/WashingtonDC/EStreetCinema.htm">E Street Cinema</a>. The concept is simple. Along with the rifle, assault pack, body armor and other gear issued to the typical American soldier, five members of a National Guard unit from New Hampshire set for deployment to Iraq were equipped with a less conventional tool: the hand-held video camera.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The embedded journalist is one of the American military\'s notable, if not altogether significant, innovations of the Iraq War.  The unkempt scribe in khakis and shades, mail-order helmet askance, packing his bags and enlisting to travel with an individual unit, ceding independence in return for access. If softening coverage was, as many allege, the Pentagon\'s intent, then this film should theoretically be an even greater realization of its mission. The bothersome vulture is disposed with entirely. Where the embedment program would cast the journalist as soldier, The War Tapes casts the soldier as journalist.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">But the result isn\'t the upbeat infomercial we\'ve come to expect from the White House and the Pentagon\'s civilian leadership. It\'s a ground-level chronicle of the frustrations, dashed hopes and anxieties that have, unfortunately, come to characterize the occupation. Arriving for their tour well after the fall of Baghdad, our guides aren\'t witness to much in the way of valor, or even combat. Instead it would seem that they spend most of their days sheparding contractors and support staff through a minefield of improvised explosives amid the palpable unease of the natives. Measuring success proves as elusive as understanding the enemy, whose appearances are limited to a few gruesome bodies strewn by the side of the road after a frenetic spasm of automatic gunfire.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Cynicism pervades the barracks, eventually afflicting even the once idealistic Michael Moriarty, a husband and father who rushed to New York after the attacks of September 11, 2001, and who, <a title="A Sept. 2003 poll found that 69 percent of American\'s believed it was likely that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in attacks conducted by al-Qaeda." href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm">like many Americans</a>, earnestly viewed the invasion as an unavoidable challenge imposed by the destruction of that day. He was so inspired by what he saw at Ground Zero, he says, that he was moved to leave his family behind and follow the president\'s call to action. By the end of their tour, the common  sentiment among the soldiers treats the war not as a benevolent, if flawed, liberation, but instead a brutish power grab in the war of all against all. Power and money is what war has always been about, Stephen Pink says after he\'s returned home to Cape Cod, and his hope is that at least some regular Americans get to taste the profits from this one.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The majority of the venom we hear from the soldier\'s lips isn\'t directed at insurgents or Iraqis, but instead the American contractors <a title="Click here to read a profile of the company and its war contracts done by my employer, The Center for Public Integrity." href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/wow/bio.aspx?act=pro&ddlC=31">Kellogg Brown & Root</a>, a subsidiary of Halliburton that has been outsourced billions of dollars worth of logistics work. The most frequent target is vice president and former Halliburton executive, Dick Cheney, who the soldiers routinely lampoon as a war profiteer.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">And after the relief and joy of their safe homecoming fades away, the story turns grim again, as the soldiers struggle to overcome physical and psychological infirmities and grapple with the challenge of reconnecting  with family and friends who are largely unable to relate to their distant experiences.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The recipient of nearly universal critical praise, having scored points for \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93<a title="Donald Levit at ReelTalk Movie Reviews" href="http://www.reeltalkreviews.com/browse/viewitem.asp?type=review&id=1711">not being preachy</a>\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d and offering an \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93<a title="The Washington Post review by Ann Hornaday" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id=1123538&lat=200.0&lon=200.0&displaySearchLocation=&nm=1&categories=Movies">unvarnished</a>\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d view of the war, it\'s worth remembering that, as <a title="Read his review here. It\'s found near the bottom of the essay." href="http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0622,atkinson,73369,20.html">the Village Voice\'s Michael Atkinson</a> emphasizes in the lone dissent I could find among major critics, there\'s one very important point of view that\'s been left out of this and most other visual depictions of the war, the Iraqi perspective. Indeed, as Atkinson observes, although I will add the exception of a Lebanese soldier who speaks Arabic and strives to connect with the natives, the voices in the film almost exclusively "disdainfully observe the indigenous populace from a distance as if they were hyenas on the veld.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">While the American psyche may yearn to withdraw and nurse its wounds after the shock of the Iraq experience, can this country truly understand the global challenge issued on Sept. 11 or the responsibilities it accepted when it invaded Iraq simply by looking in the mirror?</p>'

aS'<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In his adaptation of Philip K. Dick\'s <a title="Visit the Apple site to view the trailer." href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/warner_independent_pictures/ascannerdarkly/" target="_blank">"A Scanner Darkly,"</a> the director Richard Linklater has made a considerable achievement simply by conjuring images otherworldly enough to\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0suit Dick\'s arrhythmic work. By recasting reality in an eerie, hallucinogenic haze, Linklater has set the stage perfectly to play out Dick\'s dark vision of a not-too-distant future where drug addiction and the technology of the police state have overtaken American society.</p>\r\nIt was all done using a technique called <a title="Click here to read a Wired article about how it was done." href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.03/scanner.html" target="_blank">rotoscoping</a>. After a scene is shot with a conventional camera, the stock is loaded onto a computer where graphic artists create animations by tracing over the footage. In the days before computers, a projection machine -- named, of course, the rotoscope -- projected live footage onto a screen for the animator to trace by hand. Back then its primary use came as a reference tool, an aid for animators to help simulate complex movements like Prince Charming\'s dance steps in Disney\'s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\r\n\r\nLinklater caught a lot of attention five years ago when he put the new digital version of the technique (the software is called Rotoshop) to use in his film <a title="Click here to read the IMDB summary" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/" target="_blank">Waking Life</a>. His animators did more than just another trace job, instead splashing Linklater\'s shots onto their digital canvas and morphing the mundane everyday into a fluid dreamscape where our narrator\'s fantasies and longings could seamlessly float alongside his very lifelike movements.\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Sadly, the frontier Waking Life opened has gone largely unexplored. Maybe the stoner philosophy at its center obscured the film\'s achievements, or maybe other people don\'t see the form\'s potential as I do, but, for whatever reason, Linklater\'s use of animation\'s dazzling new vocabulary failed to inspire other directors to try and say something serious; the only significant followers coming from the world of advertising, where <a title="Visit Slate to watch and read about Charles Schwab\'s " href="http://www.slate.com/id/2131287/" target="_blank">a brokerage house</a> and an automotive company picked up on the technique to give their products a fresh, eye-catching look.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">But, for all its sheen, Linklater\'s animation turns out to be just as dependent on his characters as his best conventional work (Slacker, Dazed and Confused, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset), which, for all its visual verisimilitude, has always hinged success on the ability of his actors to connect with the audience\'s empathy and compassion. As engaged and entranced as we might be by the hynopotic visual lure of Linklater\'s images, they remain, tragically, centered on the image of one Keanu Reeves, a man with all the emotive range and timbre of a slightly overcooked brisket. While he certainly succeeds in emitting the abundance of one-liners Linklater\'s script provides with his signature quzzical grunt, sometimes even a well-delivered "Whoa!" just isn\'t enough, as the Matrix sequels and whole string of vapid romantic comedies have certainly proved.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Instead the film belongs to the supporting cast, especially Robert Downey Jr., whose heady performance as the paranoid drugdealer Barris thrills with its tempering of Hunter S. Thompson\'s addled-yet-poised diction with Downey\'s own cool California arrogance. It\'s a shame that he and his fellow costars do not play a more central role. This is particularly the case with Rory Cochrane, who turns in a wild-eyed performance as an out-of-control addict. His early scenes, especially those in interaction with Downey, spark with a energy utterly lacking in Reeves, whose performance can be summed up by the many unimaginative and tedious reverse shots of his inert visage. The same lament should be made for Winona Ryder, who surprises by managing to express more of the confusion, despair and ambivalence meant to suffuse the screen\'s every pixel in one scene than her leading man can in 100 minutes. Whoa, indeed.</p>'

By recasting the millions squandered on aging talents by media tycoon Steve Ross as the work of a committed visionary (photos of his face appear with a frequency usually reserved for dictators and religious icons) and puffing up petty indulgences and short-sighted decisions by players and managers alike as the type of European capriciousness proper to professional football, the movie aims to establish a new mythology; one that anoints the Cosmos as the lodestar of America\'s gradually increasing interest in the world\'s game.

aS'Clearly, Brandon Flowers has loosened up. Dropping the shield of affected irony clutched by so many American rock singers, The Killers\' frontman shows he\'s found the courage to break ranks and\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9davert your eyes, indie fans\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dwrite a big, anthemic rock song.\r\n\r\n"When You Were Young" (<a target="_blank" title="click here to hear the stream in real media format" href="http://www6.islanddefjam.com/www2/av_system/go.rm?link=K5MA5P8u7D456GJ74N489D3E-78072">real player</a>, <a target="_blank" title="click here to hear the stream in windows media format" href="http://www6.islanddefjam.com/www2/av_system/go.wax?link=ERfw543735Kl1158Q6me4C26-78070">windows media</a>) opens with an obnoxious riff that would easily fit in on Coldplay\'s X&Y, then goes on to unfurl a Springsteen-like narrative of young love ("We\'re burning down the highway skyline") that culimates in a surging chorus and, no joke, a "10th Avenue Freeze Out" style guitar breakdown.\r\n\r\nI\'m excited anytime I see a musician mature out of the neurotic constrictions of indie rock, but, epic as it may be, this new song isn\'t totally doing it for me. I enjoy a few of the elements, but it\'s lacking the tight arrangements required to make an arena-rock act work (ex. any U2 song). The patchwork of Springsteenarian cliches doesn\'t coalesce into an affecting story. The percussion lacks the necessary drive. And the all-important rising tension, obviously meant to climax with the slow build into the final chorus, isn\'t positioned to land with the necessary force.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it\'s still encouraging to hear a young rock band growing in this direction. Putting aside the relative merits of The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, The White Stripes or whoever else, most of the hit indie bands in recent years seem to have arrived already full-formed, oftentimes sounding more predictable than the mainstream acts they\'re supposed to be outpacing. The fresh thing about The Killers is that they seem to possess at least some potential to push beyond what they already are. Here\'s hoping they can do it. I\'m rooting for them.\r\n\r\nI\'m also rooting for another keen Stuart Price remix in keeping with <a target="_blank" title="Click here to download an .mp3" href="http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&ufid=D0EB03B51CFFB453">his take on "Mr. Brightside."</a> If anybody can weave this thing into gold, it\'s our man Jacques Lu Cont. So, Stu, if you\'re out there, I think this could really work. Rebuild the song about the big hook and the bouncing drums and brief guitar build around 1:30. Then stitch the percussion around 2:20 into a more conclusive climax. Maybe cut that Jesus line. And, really, while we\'re at it, can you just talk these guys into making dance records? Life would be so much better for everybody.'

aS"A Manhattanite's Murder Mystery."

aS'<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Hardly more ambitious or painstaking an effort than his casual magazine essays, Woody Allen\'s new comedic film, Scoop, will be lucky to inspire more than a few scant shouts and murmurs.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A young American journalism student (Scarlett Johansson) visits a magic show while studying abroad in England. When the magician Splendini (Woody Allen) stows her away inside a box for his grand finale, Johansson is visited by the ghost of recently deceased journalist (Ian McShane), who implores her to follow up on a juicy tip he picked up on the ferry across the River Styx. It would seem that one of London\'s most respected, and most attractive, young noblemen (Hugh Jackman) may indeed be the secret identity of a notorious serial killer. Intent on getting the story, but unsure of her own abilities, Johansson quickly enlists Allen in her quest to get the story.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Don\'t expect much. It\'s a flip, disposable movie with a slack, disjointed script and lightly sketched characters\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9da tossed-off take on classic romantic mysteries like His Girl Friday and The Thin Man.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">But slack and quickly castoff is a fair way to describe all of Allen\'s work. Like his best films, Scoop succeeds when it yields center stage to the subject its director knows best: himself. Even at the age of 70, Allen can still capture your attention with his outrageous anxieties and gleefully nihilistic vaudeville. His banter with Johansson offers a low-wattage version of the urbane repartee that illuminates the male-female detective comedies Allen is out to imitate, but the roles are as ill-fitting to their players as dowdy glasses to Johansson\'s face. It\'s pathetic to see a beautiful woman pretend to be ordinary, and it\'s shameful for such a talented filmmaker to shy away from exercising his strengths. What it leads to is dull film with a few small pleasures, but almost neurotic in its self-repression.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite the waves of empathy and adoration Johansson drew from young cinephiles and intellectuals with her minor-key performance in Sophia Coppola\'s Lost in Translation, it remains to be seen whether she can summon performances to match her ascendant stardom. Without a doubt, she\'s lost here, wandering unconvincingly through her paces as Allen\'s cross between Nancy Drew and Hildy Johnson. It\'s hard not to wonder whether her career would be better suited if she let her body do the talking instead of a voice that, for all its husky allure, she has yet to master.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the more interesting developments of this film is Allen\'s newfound role as father figure to his female lead. His critics have been happy to take the opportunity to underline their relief that he\'s finally relinquished a romantic role (Mahnola Dargis of The New York Times damns Scoop with the faint praise that it has less pawing of young women than any Allen film in years). While we all need a good vent from time to time, it would be nice to see such bile saved for the people who deserve it, like the cynical liars and swill merchants who brought us the crime against enlightenment known as The DaVinci Code. A harmless old comedian playing out his fantasies seems such small game in comparison. Raising the blunt power of the press against so slight a film seems as cruel and unnecessary as robbing children of the pleasures they find in Splendini\'s simple magic tricks.</p>'

aS'Faunae of Arabia.'
p62
aS'<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Last Sunday I visited The American Film Institutes\'s Silver Theatre for a screening of the 70mm restoration of Lawrence of Arabia. Believe the hype. This is one big, beautiful movie. So quit screwing around and see it while you can.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Most praise pours forth for the film\'s grand, sweeping shots of the Arabian Peninsula\'s vast desert, but I found myself fascinated by the less voluminous things: Omar Sharif\'s impeccable posture, the ragged red streaks cracking at the edges of Peter O\'Toole\'s eyes, the calm swagger of the stoic camels.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It\'s bizarre to say this about a movie that, with an intermission, runs about four hours in length, but, somehow, there is not enough there. It lacks exposition. The audience is only granted a brief introduction in the Cairo barracks before being cast out with their hero. Who is this man who would shake off his own heritage so readily, so recklessly? The ambivalence and moodiness that bedevils O\'Toole\'s Lawrence certainly enriches the film. (Many of the themes will ring bells for anyone following the modern adventure in Iraq.) But, lacking a better understanding of our traveling companion, his vacillations can be as difficult to comprehend as the desert\'s shifting winds.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A visit to AFI will require you summon your courage for the harrowing passage through that vulgar caricature of civilization known as "downtown" Silver Spring, but it\'s worth it to see a great old movie on a great big screen. They\'ll be showing this one Sunday nights all summer.</p>'

aS'A partisan split on bipartisanship.'
p67
aS'Bill Clinton has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/opinion/22clinton.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">an editorial</a> in the New York Times today. His subject: How great he was at being president. More specifically, what a huge success he thinks the changes to America\'s welfare law he signed into law 10 years ago have been.\r\n\r\nWithout venturing any critique of his major claims -- I\'m sure plenty of other, more qualified bloggers will have a go at that one today -- I\'d like to point out one little twinkie that might otherwise go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nNear the end of his piece, the former president digresses for a moment to explain how he thinks the bill made it through a Republican Congress and onto his desk.\r\n<blockquote>Regarding the politics of welfare reform, there is a great lesson to be learned, particularly in today\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s hyper-partisan environment, where the Republican leadership forces bills through Congress without even a hint of bipartisanship. Simply put, welfare reform worked because we all worked together. The 1996 Welfare Act shows us how much we can achieve when both parties bring their best ideas to the negotiating table and focus on doing what is best for the country.</blockquote>\r\nNow, back to June 8 when former House Majority Leader Tom Delay delivered <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801376_pf.html">his farewell address</a> to the chamber. When the welfare bill passed through the House, Delay held the office of majority whip. The whip is the member charged with keeping  party leadership informed about how the caucus will vote. The term was lifted from British Parliament, where it was borrowed from fox hunting. Delay is so famous for cracking down on wayward members that the word could no longer do him justice. They dubbed him "The Hammer."\r\n<blockquote>I found that it is customary in speeches such as these to reminisce about the good old days of political harmony and across-the-aisle camaraderie, and to lament the bitter, divisive partisan rancor that supposedly now weakens our democracy.\r\n\r\nWell, I can\'t do that because partisanship, Mr. Speaker, properly understood, is not a symptom of democracy\'s weakness but of its health and its strength, especially from the perspective of a political conservative.</blockquote>\r\nAnd what does The Hammer claim as one of the chief victories of his take-no-prisoners brand of conservatism? You guessed it, welfare reform.\r\n<blockquote>We reformed welfare programs that however well intentioned undermined the dignity of work and personal responsibility and perpetuated poverty.</blockquote>\r\nMaybe it depends upon what meaning of the word \'we\' is.'

aS'<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I picked up my first copy of <a href="http://www.stopsmilingonline.com/">Stop Smiling magazine</a> at News World on K and Connecticut earlier this week. Behind the curve as always, I just learned about the Chicago-based publication from <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2150494/?nav=tap3">media critic Jack Shafer\'s gushing write-up on Slate</a>. I\'m always eager to get behind anybody in the Midwest  out there trying to do their thing \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c I am from Iowa after all \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c and, despite blowing a bit too hard from time to time, I\'ve usually found Shafer\'s aim to be near the mark.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I will say this. It\'s got all the interviews a well trimmed goatee could ask for. Just in this most recent issue you can find thoughtful chats with Dave Eggers, Garrison Keillor, <span style="font-style: normal">and</span> Kurt Vonnegut. With a lineup like that you\'re 20 questions with Jon Stewart and a few cheesecake photos of Sarah Vowell shy of assembling all the pieces necessary to reconstruct the brain patterns of every young, gifted and liberal male I met in my four years as a Chicagoan.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing astride a rooftop in spike heels and a short black skirt, Laura Dawn stopped me on page 27 with a new addition to the standard come hither pose: an Iowa Hawkeyes sweatshirt. A product of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&amp;q=Pleasantville,+IA">Pleasantville, IA</a>, a small town outside Des Moines, Dawn is an aspiring rock singer who now lives in New York City and splits her time working for the Democratic activists <a href="http://www.moveon.org/">Moveon.org</a>.  Writer Annie Nocenti describes Dawn as disarming, charming, inventive, successful, radiant, elegant, demure, classic and reminiscent of both Grace Kelly <span style="font-style: normal">and</span> Princess Diana. And that\'s just in the first two paragraphs.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Speaking as someone who\'s familiar with central Iowa, let me assure you that\'s not their typical vintage.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of all the purple praise, I almost gave up on the story at the jump, ready to dismiss it as just another hack profile on par with the sympathetic softies you expect to find in newsletters aimed at people who all think the same. But, in hopes of finding a few more juicy details about my home state, I soldiered on to the story\'s conclusion on page 116.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">While I didn\'t come across anything more about Iowa, I did find a plug for a MoveOn-related book titled \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93It Takes a Nation\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d that Dawn helped to edit. After all the praise heaped her way by Nocenti, it was hard not to think this thing might be worth learning more about.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I didn\'t have to look far. But I did have to squint. The article concludes with a brief description of Nocenti that includes this disclosure, in a tiny font I\'d estimate at around five points.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Nocenti is an editor at large for STOP SMILING and was a contributing editor on <em>It Takes a Nation.</em><span style="font-style: normal"></span></blockquote>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Then I visited <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Takes-Nation-Strangers-Hurricane-Katrina/dp/1932771867/sr=8-1/qid=1159674200/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-1940535-9989560?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">the book\'s Amazon.com page</a> and found another connection. The blurb describes the book as featuring a collection of work by photojournalist Carter Smith. The photo of Dawn on page 27 that caught my eye. Yep, also credited to Carter Smith.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Flaky profile or not, it always strikes me as problematic when a journalist has a professional connection with their subject. Are they serving my interests as a reader, or an agenda of their own? Considering how the book they worked on was commissioned by the political activists at MoveOn.org, the circumstances suggest Nocenti was assigned to cover the activities of a group to which she, because of her involvement in their book,  may personally belong. How do I know this isn\'t propaganda? It doesn\'t help that she\'s elected to describe Dawn not just favorably, but lustily. Grace Kelly <em>and </em>Princess Diana.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">I sent the magazine\'s managing editor, James Hughes, an email asking if his staff had put any thought into the matter. Here is his response:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Thank you for your concerns. Annie Nocenti, one of our editors at large, is a 20-year veteran of magazine publishing, and we trust the pieces she brings into the fold. We often have writers and authors expand on their personal interactions with their colleagues in print. In fact, we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve devoted large portions of issues, like our \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Publishing\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d (22) and \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Auteurs\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d (23) issues, to writers/editors and filmmakers commenting on their collaborations with their colleagues. This is consistent with our editorial direction.\r\n\r\nIf we were a news source, this would have perhaps been handled differently. But we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re an entertainment magazine. And we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re independently owned and operated, so the outcome of Ms. Dawn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s book or other such titles is not our concern.</blockquote>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">While it\'s hard to get too worked up over a little magazine profile, I can\'t say I\'m satisfied with Hughes\' answer. Nocenti and the editors do deserve credit for disclosing the connection, but a small dose of transparency isn\'t enough to remedy my unease. The evidence of a conflict of interest creates a perception of the possibility of deception. Learning about their connection the way we do, it\'s hard not to be suspicious of the whole article being in bad faith. As far as I know, Dawn, Nocenti and Carter are best friends and political collaborators seeking to win me over with an air brushed portrait of their cause. On the other hand, I don\'t know that to be the case. Maybe they\'d never met before their interview, despite the connection on \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93It Takes a Nation.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d There\'s not enough evidence available to pass judgment either way. My assumption is that Stop Smiling, despite being an entertainment magazine, aspires to instill more confidence than this in its readers. If so, I think this sort of thing ought to be of their concern.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">But that\'s just me. What do you think? Am I being schoolmarmish? I\'m not the only one feeling queasy about this sort of thing.

aS'Is there any way I can blame the Ethiopians?'
p92
aS'One of things I\'ve most enjoyed about the blogging experiment (besides the worldwide adulation it\'s won me, of course) is that it provides a good excuse to pin down my thoughts. The posts I\'ve found most rewarding have been those where the act of writing, for even a very modest audience, has prompted some measure of constructive reflection. And that\'s been especially the case when writing about books. Having to organize and then express my thoughts about something I\'ve read can deepen what I draw out of a experience and help me sharpen my own awareness of whatever I think the book\'s message might be. Plus, if we\'re lucky, it might be interesting for you to read. Or maybe point you to a book that could make a difference in your life.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I sat down at a nearby Ethiopian restaurant last week with a pen and paper in hopes of writing a series of short book reviews about everything I\'ve read over the past few months but failed to blog about. It went okay. I wrote a lot. But then I stuffed the notes away in my bag and now when I pull them out a week later I\'m unable to piece the thoughts back together. It\'s probably a bad sign when I can\'t even read my own handwriting.\r\n\r\nSo, all I can offer tonight is a list of what I\'ve been flipping through.

aS'American Idols.'
p97
aS'One of the buzzier pieces of reporting zipping around Washington right now is Joshua Green\'s cover story on Hillary Clinton in the November edition of the Atlantic magazine (<a title="You might need to be a subscriber." target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200611/green-hillary">link</a>).\r\n\r\nIt features some illuminating reporting about Clinton\'s ballyhooed success currying favor in the Senate (Any encounter with Sen. Byrd\'s deluded, unworldly self-regard is usually good for a laugh), but Green\'s overall thesis is flawed and telling about one aspect of the sickly state of political reporting.\r\n\r\nHere\'s how the story goes: Hillary was elected to the Senate six years ago. People were skeptical. But, according to Green, she\'s had as much legislative success as a first-term minority senator could expect, remains the preeminent political figure for both the Democratic party and all political active women, maintains a legal resume to match anyone, is married to <a title="From David Remnick\'s New Yorker piece" target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060918fa_fact1">the man known as the Michael Jordan of politics</a>, can and will raise more money than God, learned well from her political mistakes on Hillarycare, is self-aware and smart, but, yet, <em>somehow</em>, just won\'t cut it as a presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nDespite that whole laundry list, and despite the no-more-impressive resumes of most other presidential contenders (not to mention the past two presidents), Green concludes she just isn\'t big enough for the job. Despite being one of the Senate\'s leading critics of the Bush adminstrations war effort, despite prompting hardline foes to seek forgiveness for past grievances, despite winning over a New York electorate that was highly skeptical of the legitimacy in her initial campaign, and despite doing all this while under unmatched media scrutiny and a freshman member of the Democratic party\'s most politically impotent Congressional delegation in several generations, Hillary Clinton just isn\'t getting enough done for Mr. Green.\r\n\r\nA lot of people make rational arguments against a second Clinton presidency. Some Democrats look at the polls and say Hillary can\'t win. Many Republicans and independents look at Hillary\'s track record and say she shouldn\'t win. And most of the time they have solid reasons for taking those positions. They\'re based on reason and principle. You can disagree. You can argue against them. They\'re empirical.\r\n\r\nJoshua Green eloquently lays out and reports a whole array of arguments that do not support his main thesis, yet he fails to synthesize the facts in another way. Why? He reveals himself, inadvertantly it seems, when applying his critique to Clinton\'s rationalization of her vote to authorize military action against Iraq in the fall of 2002 and how she sees her position as distinct from that most unfashionable of senators, Joe Lieberman.\r\n\r\nGreen quotes Clinton in full, lauds her for her elocution and poise, admires the nuance of her peformance, and then swiftly dismisses the substance of the argument. What\'s that sound like? The talent competition in a beauty contest!\r\n\r\nWe see this approach toward evaluation again during Green\'s breathless recounting of how he briefly basked in the wake of Clinton\'s fame. Most of the time Green seems bored with Hillary the person, hiding, as he says, "behind a screen of detail." It is when he observes her leaping on stage  with Oprah Winfrey at the International Emmys to the crowd\'s roaring approval that Green seems to regard her as most worthy to lead the world\'s lone superpower. He writes: "<font class="arttype">It sounds corny, but it was really exciting!"</font>\r\n\r\nLike a lot of people who are passionate enough about politics to dedicate their career to it, Green displays a hunger for charisma, for a sense of authenticity in America\'s leader. He seems to be looking for inspiration, for a higher calling. No more compromises. The truth, at last. I\'ve seen this a lot in young liberals since I\'ve moved to Washington.  I\'ve seen it in their muted admiration for John McCain\'s aura of integrity, in the persisting cult of JFK, in the rise of Barack Obama (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7B26311CE6-68DD-4F88-B1FA-8398AB129374%7D">See this recent beauty contest review from the supposed "reality-based community"</a>). But what they\'re searching for is as fleeting as the rush after a first kiss. Not only is there little reason to believe emotional attraction will inspire sound public policy, but we\'ve got a century full of anecdotal evidence suggesting that it isn\'t the best way to choose who runs your republic.\r\n\r\nBut if it\'s all about showmanship, if Green\'s way is how it\'s going to go nationwide, then Hillary is in trouble. It\'s clear. She doesn\'t make our nipples quiver anymore. The thrill is gone and there may be nothing she can say -- or broadcast a million times on television -- that will win us back. Whether you\'re for Hillary or against her, let\'s hope we\'re better than that.'

aS'The Difference: Claire McCaskill for U.S. Senate.'
p102
aS'A lot can change in two years. Just ask Donald Rumsfeld. Or Claire McCaskill. On Election Day 2004, Matt Blunt defeated the Missouri state auditor in the open race to be Missouri\'s governor. Last night, the same electorate saw her name on the ballot again and this time chose her over incumbent U.S. Sen. Jim Talent.\r\n\r\nI\'ve pulled together a simple spreadsheet you can download <strong><a target="_blank" title="Claire 06 v. Claire 04.xls" href="http://www.palewire.com/Claire06vClaire04.xls">here</a></strong> that racks the numbers and runs some comparisons. The quickest thing to scan is where McCaskill improved the most, which finds the largest vote share increases in Clark, Scotland, Lewis, Schuyler and Shannon counties. Each sent McCaskill greater than 10 percentage points more than last time around.\r\n\r\nThose are some impressive leaps, but perhaps more crucial were the slightly smaller increases she won in larger, still predominately Republican counties like Greene, Jasper and Christian, each of which delivered a considerably larger amount of her overall vote total than in 2004.\r\n\r\nI\'m far from an expert on Missouri politics (I only lived there two years), but it seems pretty impressive that McCaskill was able to bump her share in Greene county by more than five percentage points. It seems likely that she had a harder time there last time around because Springfield is Matt Blunt\'s home ballpark, but I wonder what these changes might be able to tell us about the state\'s political landscape. Certainly, there are all the shake-and-bake explanations we\'ve heard<em> ad nauseum</em> on the cable news for more than a month now, but I suspect a knowledgeable<span style="font-size: 12pt"> </span>nose could sniff out something fresh here. If you\'ve got one, why don\'t you give it a shot? Could be fun.'

aS'Sorted! The 30 Greatest Albums in the History of 1990-1999.'
p107
aS'Duty calls for another online poll. This time the challenge is to name the best albums of the 1990s and order them by their relative quality.\r\n\r\nThe polling is weighted. One hundred points can be distributed among your top 10, with a maximum of 30 points for any one entry. A more savvy voter might have made his weighting decisions based upon political intent, perhaps by throwing more points behind an album judged to have a better shot of finding a consensus and topping the ultimate listing. But, playing this one by the book, I just tried to quantify my opinion in an orderly fashion.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I guess that means I think Different Class is seven times better than Elastica. Which, now that i think about it, is pretty crazy. That album\'s <a title="Yeah!" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COCuS1q_Lcs">awesome</a>.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as usual, let me know what I\'m an idiot for forgetting. And feel free to post your list in the comments. That would be cool.\r\n\r\n30. Super Furry Animals - Guerrilla (2)\r\n29. Belle and Sebastian - Tigermilk (2)\r\n28.

aS'<p class="MsoNormal">In case you missed it, Tower Records is going out of business. Not that you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d know it from looking at <a href="http://www.towerrecords.com/Default.aspx">their Web site</a>, but the company <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003221956" target="_blank">filed for bankruptcy in August</a>. For the past couple months its assets have been busy being liquidated by <a href="http://www.greatamerican.com/" target="_blank">Great American Group</a>, which seems like an awfully lofty name for an organization that functions as the corporate equivalent of a chop shop.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">This provides a nice opportunity for music geeks everyone to wring their hands about the death of the record store. But not me. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll save my eulogies for the shops \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c like <a href="http://www.reckless.com/" target="_blank">Reckless Records in Chicago</a> or <a href="http://www.thinkinground.com/">CD Warehouse here in DC</a> \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c that I actually care about.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Tower does deserve credit for whatever effort it made to leaven the deadening uniformity of most major record stores with a local releases and a deep selection, but, sorry, none of that ever did much for me. Years of digging through the racks in search my latest favorite, only to find it with a $17.99 sticker slapped on the back (or worse, and I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not kidding, $33.99 for an import) calloused me. Ben\'s heart was hardened. The market has spoken. Tower must go.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">But not before I loot through the remains in search of bargains. Sweet, sweet bargains.</p>\r\nSo, here, dear reader, are samples from some of the stuff I picked up earlier today.

p137
aS'I\'ve considered myself a foot soldier in the battle for better baseball thinking since my undergraduate years, a fight I can\'t claim much more participation in than a somewhat mean-spirited eagerness to challenge conventional wisdom and rankle old folks by mocking television commentators and deriding the myth of the "leadoff hitter."\r\n\r\nWhile I\'d already read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818/sr=8-1/qid=1168885252/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&s=books">Moneyball</a>\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9deasily the most provocative book to hit baseball in my lifetime, though perhaps not as a significant to the larger culture as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Juiced-Times-Rampant-Roids-Baseball/dp/B000FIHZDW/sr=8-1/qid=1168883833/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&s=books">Juiced</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Shadows-Steroids-Scandal-Professional/dp/1592401996/sr=8-1/qid=1168885233/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&s=books">Game of Shadows</a>\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dI couldn\'t resist picking up the latest paperback reissue late last year when I saw it included a new afterward by the author, Michael Lewis.\r\n\r\nWhat a blast. Lewis\' response to the baseball establishment\'s irrational and foolhardy rejection of his findings carry enough force that, to a hometown fan like myself, reading it feels nearly as good as watching the Cubs seal a tight game by racking up a half dozen runs in the top of the 10th inning.\r\n\r\nBut, beyond that, what most captured my mind on this run through Lewis\' paean to the Oakland A\'s and Billy Beane wasn\'t any of the empirical arguments that have earned his subjects so much respect. Instead it was a rhetorical tool more familiar to the school of literary folk wisdom that has dominated baseball for most of its history\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dexactly the crowd most threatened by the book\'s implications.\r\n\r\nHere, on pg. 222, Lewis uses a favorite device of old-school sports writers, the metaphor, to illuminate his hero\'s data-driven approach to evaluating pitchers.\r\n<blockquote>His reduced circumstances had forced Billy Beane to embrace a different mental model of the Big League Pitcher. In Billy Beane\'s mind, pitchers were nothing like high-performance sports cars, or thoroughbred racehorses, or any other metaphor that implied a cool, inbuilt superiority. They were more like writers. Like writers, pitchers initiated action, and set the tone for their games. They had all sorts of ways of achieving their effects and they needed to be judged by those effects, rather than by their outward appearance, or their technique. To place a premium on velocity for its own sake was like placing a premium on a big vocabulary for its own sake. To say all pitchers should pitch like Nolan Ryan was as absurd as insisting that all writers should write like John Updike. Good pitchers were pitchers who got outs; how they did it was beside the point.</blockquote>\r\nClear, effective writing. I dig it.'

That\'s just over 2 percent of the total (2.5 percent if you let me sneak in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blind-Into-Baghdad-Americas-Iraq/dp/0307277968/sr=8-1/qid=1169387659/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">James Fallows\' repackaged magazine articles,</a> which I totally swear I read in their original serialized form in The Atlantic).\r\n\r\nIt\'s no surprise that after you lump George W. Bush, Karl Rove, the recently deposed Republican Congress, Iraq, Osama and the 2004 election into one big red pile, it easily tops the list of most commonly recurring topics. Deservedly so, I would say. I won\'t feel like an informed citizen until I\'ve cracked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Looming-Tower-Al-Qaeda-Road-11/dp/037541486X/sr=8-1/qid=1169388020/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">The Looming Tower</a> and despite all I\'ve already picked up in newspapers, magazines and elsewhere, I\'m still interested in learning more.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Looming-Tower-Al-Qaeda-Road-11/dp/037541486X/sr=8-1/qid=1169388020/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank"> </a>I can\'t say the same for topic number two.

I\'m sure much of it is quality work, but the shrill tone wears on me.  The overheated eagerness in journalistic and left-wing circles to distinguish oneself from the Bush administration and <span class="hw">unfashionable</span> elements of its constituency (see the preening fixation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community" target="_blank">the now notorious "reality-based community" quote</a>), grants any use of the right-wing\'s alarmist rhetorical tactics a special whiff of hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nAnd, to me, a lot of this stuff about the impending Christian overthrow of the Constitution is packaged in exactly the same language as all the right-wing noise about the liberal conspiracy to destroy America. Look no further than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Godless-Church-Liberalism-Ann-Coulter/dp/1400054206/ref=pd_sim_b_3/002-6979142-2096055" target="_blank">Ann Coulter\'s Godless</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Party-Death-Democrats-Courts-Disregard/dp/1596980044/sr=1-1/qid=1169394706/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">Ramesh Ponnuru\'s The Party of Death</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-Totalitarian-Temptation-Mussolini/dp/0385511841/sr=1-1/qid=1169394725/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">Jonah Goldberg\'s Liberal Fascism</a> and, my latest favorite, Dinesh D\'Souza\'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enemy-At-Home-Cultural-Responsibility/dp/0385510128/sr=1-1/qid=1169388996/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6979142-2096055?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank"><span class="sans">The Enemy At Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11</span></a>.\r\n\r\nIt\'s possible that I\'m missing the severity of these supposedly dire conflicts. Yet if things were grave as we\'re told, I\'d like to think the threat would be more apparent. As far as I can detect from my own experiences combined with observations gleaned from sources that I trust, both sides here have gone a bit overboard. But I guess that\'s what people think will sell books. Or maybe I\'m wrong. Maybe, to torture a phrase, the barbarians are at the gate (or the crusaders, depending on your politics). You tell me. My intention isn\'t to be dismissive.\r\n\r\nAnd not to get too intense about it, but if two strongly opposed sides can each get away with labeling the other fascist without any clear contradictions, that means the battle George Orwell took up in 1946 has failed to progress much at all. In his essay <a href="http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/patee.html" target="_blank">Politics and the English Language</a> Orwell wrote:\r\n<blockquote>The word <em>Fascism</em> has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies "something not desirable." The words <em>democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice</em> have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another...\r\n\r\n...One ought to recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.  If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak  any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one\'s own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase -- some <em>jackboot, Achilles\' heel, hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno, </em> or other lump of verbal refuse -- into the dustbin, where it belongs.</blockquote>'

11,647 pages. If you divide that number by 365 you get 31.9, which is how many pages someone would have to read every single day of the year to finish all 31 books.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Impressive enough, right? Does anyone here read more than 30 pages a day?</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Yet, remember, the claim isn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t that President Bush read 31 books last year. No, the claim is that he read 60 books\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dand all of them by August 20.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Without knowing the complete list of titles, it\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s impossible to generate an exact page total. One alternative is to assume that the rest of the books were of approximately the same length as the titles we do know. The average length of the 31 books listed above is just over 375 pages. Since we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re 29 books short of our total, let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s multiply that by 375, which rounds out to about 10,895 additional pages of reading. That nearly doubles our earlier total of 11,647 up to an estimated 22,543 pages of reading. <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">A quick run through the calendar shows August 20 to have been the 232nd day of the year. What\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s 22,543 divided by 232? It\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s 97. So, according to our calculations, President Bush would have to had to read approximately 97 pages every day for 232 consecutive days to have mowed through a sixty-book reading list.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Without getting into the academic research on reading rates and comprehension, let\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s just assume that the President proceeded at the straightforward and brisk pace of one page per minute. The simple 1:1 page-to-minute ratio demands more than an hour and a half of reading time each and every day. Two minutes per page? That, of course, doubles the president\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s daily reading regime to more than three hours every day.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">Now, far be it from me to judge anyone here, but assuming my math is right that\'s  a pretty steep hill for anyone to climb. My guess is that it\'s likely to have been a wee bit of an exaggeration.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">For anyone interested, here are the presidential book titles I found from before 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style="width: 457px"><font size="2"><strong>Title</strong></font></td>\r\n<td style="width: 121px"><font

p162
aS'About two months ago I started using the social bookmarking site <a target="_blank" href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> to save and tag my favorite news stories. A couple hundreds links later, I\'ve built a nice collection. Below you can find the tags I\'ve selected displayed visually.\r\n\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/tags/palewire?size=10-36;color=87ceeb-0000ff"></script>If you\'ve never seen one, this is what is known as a tag cloud. The crowd over at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">Wikipedia</a> defines it this way:\r\n<blockquote>A Tag Cloud is a text-based depiction of tags across a body of content to show frequency of tag usage and enable topic browsing. In general, the more commonly used tags are displayed with a larger font or stronger emphasis. Each term in the tag cloud is a link to the collection of items that have that tag.</blockquote>\r\nWhile it makes for a fun little toy, the whole effort is certainly hampered by capricious and inconsistent coding on my part. At its core, this project is founded on mapping complex news stories to simple nominal categories for quantitative analysis. Because the creation and execution of my coding routines have been, to be kind, pretty loose, you shouldn\'t expect more than a foggy view on the perculiarities of how I consume and categorize news. For insight into the news itself, it\'s best you trust the professionals.\r\n\r\nShould anyone be interested, you can track a feed of my latest links in the left side bar under the heading Ben\'s News Bag -- also available <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/palewire">via RSS</a> -- and keep up with the news cloud here or on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.palewire.com/?p=15">my media diet page</a>, where I\'ve installed an identical module just above my blogroll.'

aS'SQL Recipe: Federal government working days between two dates.'
p167
aS'If you\'d ever like to programmatically determine the number of federal working days between two dates, here\'s a quick and dirty solution I cooked up the other day in Microsoft SQL Server. It can be useful in monitering deadlines and evaluating bureaucratic processing speeds (say, for example, a log of Freedom of Information Act requests).\r\n\r\nIt\'s a three-step process.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Create a calendar table that distinguishes working days from weekends and holidays.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create a user-defined function that will use that calendar to count the number of working days between two dates.</li>\r\n\t<li>Count the days.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nBelow you can find a calendar creation script I adapted from one published on <a href="http://classicasp.aspfaq.com/date-time-routines-manipulation/how-do-i-count-the-number-of-business-days-between-two-dates.html" target="_blank">aspfaq.com</a>. Besides distinguishing weekdays from weekends, it marks off all federal holidays -- as specificed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management -- from Jan. 1, 2000 to Dec. 31, 2010.\r\n\r\nFirst we create the calendar table. It will have three fields, one for the date and then two binary fields, one that will automatically determine the weekdays using the DATEPART function, and another that we will use later to designate working days.\r\n<blockquote><code>CREATE TABLE dbo.FederalCalendar (\r\ndt SMALLDATETIME PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED,\r\nisWeekDay AS CONVERT(BIT, CASE\r\nWHEN DATEPART(dw, dt) IN (1,7) THEN 0\r\nELSE 1 END),\r\nisWorkDay BIT DEFAULT 1\r\n);\r\nGO</code></blockquote>\r\nNext we need to populate the date field, dt, with the range of days in our calendar. In this case, it will be from Jan. 1, 2000 through Dec. 31, 2010.\r\n<blockquote> <code>DECLARE @dt SMALLDATETIME;\r\nSET @dt = \'20000101\';\r\nWHILE @dt</code>&lt;<code>= \'20101231\'\r\nBEGIN\r\nINSERT dbo.FederalCalendar(dt) SELECT @dt;\r\nSET @dt = @dt + 1;\r\nEND</code></blockquote>\r\nThen winnow down our working days field by eliminating the weekends.\r\n<blockquote><code>UPDATE dbo.FederalCalendar\r\nSET isWorkDay = 0\r\nWHERE isWeekday = 0;</code></blockquote>\r\nAnd finish the job by knocking out all of the federal holidays. Of course you could modify this to reflect any other schedule you\'d like to work with, such as trading days on Wall Street or the official holidays in your state.\r\n<blockquote><code>UPDATE dbo.FederalCalendar\r\nSET isWorkDay = 0\r\nWHERE isWorkDay = 1\r\nAND dt IN\r\n(\r\n--2000 Federal Holidays\r\n-- New Year\'s Day holiday was observed on 12/31/1999\r\n\'20000117\', -- Martin Luther

create a user-defined function to take two dates and count the number of federal working days between the them.\r\n<blockquote><code>CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[FederalWorkingDays]\r\n(\r\n@startDate SMALLDATETIME,\r\n@endDate SMALLDATETIME\r\n)\r\nRETURNS INT\r\nAS\r\nBEGIN</code>\r\n\r\nDECLARE @result INT\r\n\r\n<code>SELECT @result = COUNT(*)\r\nFROM dbo.FederalCalendar\r\nWHERE dt </code>&gt;<code>= @startDate\r\nAND dt </code>&lt;<code>= @endDate\r\nAND isWorkDay = 1;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>RETURN  @result</code>\r\n\r\n<code>END</code></blockquote>\r\nOnce you\'ve run that, all you should need to do to is write a query that uses your new function. Here are two examples:\r\n<blockquote><code>SELECT dbo.FederalWorkingDays(datefield1, datefield2)\r\nFROM table</code>\r\n\r\n<code>SELECT dbo.FederalWorkingDays(\'01/01/2007\', \'02/14/2007\')</code></blockquote>\r\nAnd that\'s the end of our journey. I hope it can be helpful to somebody. As always, if there\'s something screwed up or missed, just drop a comment. We\'ll sort things out.'

aS'Like many of my fellow pale, white Americans, I have a job that requires I spend most of the work day seated in front of a computer.\r\n\r\nIt comes with a few negatives. I have minor neck pain. I\'ve gained a little weight. And I\'ve developed a highly refined, and easily inflamed, sensitivity toward the shortcomings of different varieties of database development software. None of which is probably doing much for my sex appeal. Especially that last one.\r\n\r\nBut it has its advantages, too. I enjoy the work. I\'m blessed with great coworkers. And it\'s possible to complete most of my job while also engaging in one of my favorite hobbies: listening to pop music.\r\n\r\nTo make the most of the opportunity, I decided several months ago to purchase a good pair of headphones, the <a href="http://www.gradolabs.com/product_pages/sr80.htm">Grado SR-80</a>. While I won\'t pretend to be an expert on the subject, they\'ve certainly been great for me.\r\n\r\nAnd, more recently, I\'m signed up for an account at the social networking site <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm</a>. Now every time I listen to a song it\'s cataloged by a little bug on my computer that sends the track back to their site. You can watch what I\'m up to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/palewire/">here</a>. You should go join yourself, too. It\'ll be fun. (And if you do, add me as a friend!)\r\n\r\nSince <a href="http://www.palewire.com/?p=42">I\'ve written about last.fm and the RSS feed of recent tracks over there in the sidebar before</a>, I won\'t ramble too far. But I do have something new. Below is a quilt of album covers that displays artwork from the music I\'ve been listening to lately.\r\n<iframe src="http://www.palewire.com/Quilt.htm" frameborder="0" height="290" width="475"></iframe>\r\n\r\nIt\'s dynamically generated and updated by last.fm. You can check it out anytime right here or over on <a href="http://www.palewire.com/?p=15">my media diet page</a>. Pointless indeed, but at least marginally entertaining. Sort of like this blog, I suppose. When we\'re clicking, at least.'

And a bit interesting, though hardly surprising, that the band\'s debut album, Funeral, played pretty high in most reviews.\r\n\r\nHow about how often "war" makes its way in?\r\n\r\nI made the hypecloud using a free application developed by a bright guy named Chirag Mehta.

aS'I walked up to see Hot Chip perform last night at the <a href="http://www.930.com" target="_blank">9:30 Club</a>. If you haven\'t heard these guys, they got some <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/hotchip/warning?q=hot%20chip" target="_blank">solid love</a> last year and even some mainstream video play thanks to the funky breakout single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHB9F8tvGVM" target="_blank">"Over and Over."</a>\r\n\r\nAlright show. I dug the <a href="http://fideliofm.altervista.org/_altervista_ht/resources/images/Hot%20Chip%20@%20North%20Six%20(phone).jpg" target="_blank">slackerish twist</a> they put on <a href="http://jan.moesen.nu/media/photos/2004/03/kraftwerk-in-de-ab/20040323-kraftwerk-in-de-ab-54-music-non-stop.jpg" target="_blank">Kraftwerk\'s style</a> of stagecraft and when things really got rumbling the music hit with serious heft. It reminded me a bit of the industrial shows from my Chicago days put on by Ministry and KMFDM.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing missing yet are the songs. Even the group\'s best material often ignores the model of rising tension and dramatic, climatic release capitalized on by the rhythmic pop music I most enjoy.  Sadly, the new songs they played didn\'t show much progress there.'

p202
aS'It\'s an unsettling thing that success can so easily be made to look like corruption. You\'ll find a good and pretty darn funny example in <a href="http://www.thetvset.net/" target="_blank">The TV Set</a>, a smart ring-up of the vulgarities of network television I caught tonight at E Street Cinema down by Ford\'s Theatre.\r\n\r\nWhile hardly a new theme -- artist meets suit, integrity meets compromise --  I enjoyed how the conflict was brought to life by dramatizing the way coercion and criticism can be cloaked in the rhetoric of persuasion and euphemism.\r\n\r\nWhen the imperious network executive (Sigourney Weaver) wants to dumb down the pet project of an earnest writer (David Duchovny), she doesn\'t directly confront him with her demands. His will is slowly bent through a series of passive-aggressive maneuvers that erode his resistance and are undertaken with a smile sandwiched between empty compliments. Looming at every turn, of course, is the unspoken knowledge that one side of the table is holding all of the cards.\r\n\r\nUnlike other recent workplace satires like The Office or Dilbert, where bureaucratic gamesmanship and corporate happy talk are depicted as the shield and song of the incompetent, The TV Set aims to show how it can also be the sword of the ambitious and the powerful. Plus it\'s really funny.'

aS'The Clientele @ Black Cat.'
p212
aS'The first time someone told me about The Clientele five or six years ago, refinement was the selling point. This wasn\'t you average pop band. This was a following. An exquisite cause that rewarded the discerning few cultivated to appreciate its recordings.\r\n\r\nLike previous favorites of the quiet and shy among us -- Felt, The Field Mice, Galaxie 500 -- the band\'s style goes a good way toward encouraging this view. The music is soft and whispery with a warm, bedroom sound and a striking capacity to communicate yearning and dread. In other words, everything a mopey, young indie kid could want. Have a look.\r\n\r\n<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uE2YCGxh31Q&hl=en"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/uE2YCGxh31Q&hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nSo it\'s easy to go along with the theory. That is until you see them live, as I did last night at Black Cat, a nightclub here in Washington. That\'s when you find out that The Clientele has secretly been a pop group all along.\r\n\r\nI doubt even the most delicate live show could recreate the gentle arrangements and heavily treated sounds from The Clientele\'s recordings. Real life isn\'t so tidy.\r\n\r\nBut during its lively and at times ramshackle performance last night, there was a easy embrace of things alien to the group\'s early releases. Pop refrains happily leapt from Alasdair MacLean\'s throat. Songs that lilted up from home speakers like smoke rings easily gave way to towering guitar wank. Lively banter between the group and a sarcastic, if adoring, audience. One guy clapping to the beat.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty cool. And still soft and lovely when it needed to be. Good show.\r\n\r\nHave a listen to <a href="http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/The%20Clientele%20-%20Bookshop%20Casanova.mp3" title="Alasdair MacLean: \'This is going to make us millionaires.\'" target="_blank">one of the new songs</a> from the God Save The Clientele, which is out this spring.

aS'Who is the Daily Muckiest?'
p222
aS'One of the hits I make each day as part of my morning reading is <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/cats/the_daily_muck/">The Daily Muck</a>. It\'s a quick and easy digest of investigative news stories published by one of the hotter political blogs, <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com">TPMmuckraker.com</a>.\r\n\r\nI doubt it\'s anywhere near as well-read as other tip sheets like the <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Drudge Report</a> or <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=3105267&amp;page=1">The Note</a>, but I find it to be a good way to keep tabs on the pulse of Washington, particularly what issues are resonating with the young, left-of-center types embodied by the site\'s leader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall">Josh Marshall</a>.\r\n\r\nMarshall\'s greatest claim to fame is his site\'s role in driving the scandal currently nagging at Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. There is a conventional wisdom already taking shape in Washington. It <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04272007/transcript2.html">goes</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9083501" target="_blank">like</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-blogs17mar17,0,4018765,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines">this</a>: By collecting, digesting and analyzing a wide menu of news stories from across the country, Marshall and his fellow bloggers were the first journalists to connect all of the dots and press for greater inquiry into the Department of Justice\'s firing of a number of high-level prosecutors.\r\n\r\nAs the story goes, TPM\'s virtue wasn\'t in discovering any new information (though they have done that).  Instead they\'re credited for their assiduous job of surveying the information available and pressing their conclusions.\r\n\r\nThinking about this got me interested in knowing a little bit more about where they get their information and what sources they favor.\r\n\r\nSo this morning I fired off a quick experiment. I set out to find out which Web sites and news organizations the Daily Muck cites most. Who, in other words, is the muckiest?\r\n\r\nFor anyone that\'s interested, <a href="http://www.palewire.com/wp-content/uploads/muckiest.xls">here</a> is a spreadsheet with the results.\r\n\r\nWhat you can see is that Daily Muck citations have been dominated by the print news outlets that most closely cover Washington politics. The Washington Post, The NY Times, Roll Call, and the wire services provided by Boston.com and Yahoo news dominate the list. You\'ll note that the McClatchy team at RealCities.com (formerly Knight-Ridder)  so widely celebrated for its critical coverage of the buildup to the Iraq war has won frequent citation and, as you move down the list, you can see that the remainder is filled out by mid-sized newspapers, Washington blogs, and a few alternative news sources, like my employer <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org">The Center for Public Integrity</a>.\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re looking at the ranking, there are a couple of things to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nOne: One link does not equal one citation. In many cases,  multiple links are provided inside of one feature.\r\n\r\nTwo: All those links to Boston.com does not mean that the Globe had the most stories featured. I haven\'t exhaustively studied the postings, but my cursory analysis this morning suggests that the Daily Muck\'s authors often use Boston.com as the source of the stories they want to highlight written by the Associated Press and other wire services. You\'d have to examine the records more closely to figure  just where the Globe, or AP, figures in the reckoning.\r\n\r\nThree: I have not thoroughly standardized the records. Sites that have variations in their domain name (thehill.com vs. www.thehill.com or  www.washingtonpost.com vs. blogs.washingtonpost.com) are reported as separate entities. The data could certainly use some more scrubbing, so don\'t treat it as gospel.\r\n\r\nFour: I ground this our very quickly. The archive page <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/cats/the_daily_muck/">here</a> provides a scroll-like archive of all the Muck posts ranging back to February 2006. I snatched the posts out of the html source code, dumped it into a text file and then parsed out all of the domain names using a quick script. Here it is for any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_reporting">CAR</a> heads or fellow Perl hacks in the crowd.\r\n<blockquote><code>#!/usr/bin/perl -w\r\nuse strict;\r\nuse HTML::TokeParser;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>my $folder = \'C:/temp\';</code>\r\n\r\n<code>my $Muckfile =  $folder . \'/muckfile.txt\';\r\nopen(Muckfile, "<", $Muckfile ) or die "I\'m dead";</code>\r\n\r\n<code>my $Muckurls =  $folder . \'/muckurls.txt\';\r\nopen(Muckurls, ">", $Muckurls ) or die "I\'m dead";</code>\r\n\r\n<code>my $p = HTML::TokeParser->new($Muckfile);</code>\r\n\r\n<code>while (my $token = $p->get_tag("a")) {\r\nmy $url = $token->[1]{href} || "-";\r\nif ( $url =~ m/http/ ){\r\nif ( $url =~ /\\bhttp\\:\\/\\/(.*?)\\b\\/\\b/) {\r\nmy $cleanurl = $1;\r\nif ($cleanurl !~ m/www.tpmmuckraker.com/ ) {\r\nprint Muckurls "$cleanurl\\n";\r\n}\r\n}\r\n}\r\n}</code>\r\n\r\n<code>close Muckurls;\r\nclose Muckfile;</code></blockquote>\r\nI used the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/HTML-Parser-3.56/lib/HTML/TokeParser.pm">HTML::TokeParser</a> module to extract all of the links. You\'ll note that there are three tiers in my loop, each with its own regular expression. They\'re intended to act as filters. The first limits the results to only the links that lead to URLs opening with the standard \'http,\' thereby eliminating a number of internal references; the second extracts the string commonly found between a URL\'s \'http\' stem and the \'/\' following its domain name, this standardizes links from different pages published by the same site using their common root (ex. washingtonpost.com); the third removes any links to pages on the TPM site, since we\'re only interested here in the links they make to other sites.\r\n\r\nIt\'s quick and it\'s dirty, but it gives us a rough idea.'

aS'Did Raimi Meet Woody?'
p227
aS'Am I nuts, or are there some deep shades of Woody Allen in Sam Raimi\'s Spiderman 3?\r\n\r\nI\'m serious. Let me lay it out.\r\n\r\nThe new Spiderman movie features:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The sunrise over Manhattan.</li>\r\n\t<li>Our anxious, self-conscious hero struggling to sort out his life and love from a shabby New York apartment.</li>\r\n\t<li>Romantic bonding during a playful, exuberant adventure in the kitchen (think: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BayFaUXwrAk" target="_blank">Annie Hall</a>).</li>\r\n\t<li>A date set in an urban jazz club brightened by 1930s-style crooning.</li>\r\n\t<li>A lovers\' rendezvous on location in Central Park;</li>\r\n\t<li>Quick, cutting quips targeting religion (I\'m not kidding. A vengeful Peter Parker actually says "Want forgiveness? Get religion.")</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOkay, of course, it isn\'t a Woody Allen movie.\r\n\r\nFor one, bullet points aside, a large portion of the movie is made up of fast-paced, computer-generated violence.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps more significantly, the moral of this movie isn\'t something you can spot in Woody\'s pictures. By the end of Spiderman 3, both hero and villain alike have learned a lesson: Happiness and satisfaction come from mutual bonds of sacrifice and concern between lovers and friends.\r\n\r\nWhen the characters become too wrapped up in themselves, they range from self-absorbed to homicidal. When each learns to listen and forgive, they find inner peace (and outer peace, too, since they\'ve stopped trying to kill each other.)\r\n\r\nThat\'s hardly like any Woody Allen movie I can remember. You might disagree, but to me it seems almost the opposite. For Allen\'s protagonists,  resolution is found by rejecting the traditions of your fellow man and attuning yourself to an inner compass. Worry about you, then the rest will follow.\r\n\r\nWhile it may work for Woody, it\'s hard to imagine a superhero movie where saving the girl didn\'t come first.'

aS'Good news. <a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/Market/WashingtonDC/WashingtonDC_Frameset.htm" target="_blank">E Street Cinema</a> has decided to hold over their run of the restoration of <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/killer_of_sheep/" target="_blank">Killer of Sheep</a>, Charles Burnett\'s beautiful 1977 film about the Los Angeles slum Watts.\r\n\r\nPart French New Wave, part <em>verite </em>documentary, it\'s a long way from your normal movie. It\'s a bleak and slow-paced. The budget was next to nothing. There isn\'t much of a plot. The main subject is poverty. Many of the actors were amateurs.\r\n\r\nBut at several moments its dream-like passages capture feelings of longing, tragedy and frustration with a power I\'ve rarely seen in an American film.\r\n\r\nThey don\'t come in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMsYg_tACZQ">emotional showdowns</a> or tissy-fit histrionics required to draw attention in Hollywood today. Instead, this is a movie that sneaks up on you, its moments of clarity and beauty leaping up out of the gravel to catch your eye.\r\n\r\nIn its own silent way, the scene where our protagonists, a husband (Henry Sanders) and his lonely wife (Kaycee Sanders), ebb to and fro with <a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/944112-fa7">Dinah Washington\'s "This Bitter Earth"</a> is a quiet, romantic <em>tour de force</em> with more movement and punch than eight hours of opera.\r\n\r\nAnd you\'ll probably never have a chance to see it on the big screen again.'

aS'What will the Chinese Olympics look like?'
p237
aS'Last weekend I ran through James Mann\'s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/China-Fantasy-Leaders-Explain-Repression/dp/0670038253/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-4055846-9649705?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183229012&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">The China Fantasy</a>.\r\n\r\nHis point is pretty simple. China is ruled by a repressive, single-party system. And, despite what George Bush or Thomas Friedman might tell you, there\'s a pretty good chance that may not change anytime soon.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the book walks through Mann\'s arguments against past and present American accommodation of the current Chinese regime. His main villain is the common theory that China\'s boom in economic development is almost certain to act as the catalyst for democratic reforms. Mann says maybe, but maybe not.\r\n\r\nI won\'t go any further unpacking his argument. (If you\'re interested in learning more, you can borrow my copy of the book. It\'s short enough that you can burn through it on a bus ride from DC to New York City, as I did last Saturday. Or you can get a taste of Mann\'s argument by reading <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/18/AR2007051801640.html" target="_blank">an Op-Ed he wrote</a> for the Washington Post last month.) But one interesting thing I would like to share is this prediction Mann throws out near the book\'s ending. I\'m curious to watch this play out in the media next year in the run up to the Beijing Olympics.\r\n<blockquote>Before the summer Olympics, as visitors are preparing to come to Beijing, Chinese leaders will undoubtedly tell the world that change is coming, that their political system is opening up. They will, in fact, probably take some tantalizing actions, ones that hold out the prospect for far-reaching change. In the spring of 2008, China\'s newspapers and other news media may, for a time, be permitted unprecedented freedom. At Chinese universities and think tanks, intellectuals will launch new explorations of the concept of checks and restraints on the power of the ruling Chinese Communist Party -- for example, by increasing the power of the National People\'s Congress, China\'s toothless legislature. In general, as the Olympics approach, there will probably be a period of greater tolerance for dissent and for political opposition.\r\n\r\nThis is the China that will be on display for tens of thousands of visitors who come to Beijing for the Olympics. China\'s leaders will want the visitors to see a country that is enlightened, open-minded, and on the verge of far-reaching political change. The first test for the regime, as mentioned previously, will be whether it can protect its image during the games by keeping its citizenry under control. If things work out right, the foreign guests will never see or know how hard China\'s Miinistry of State Security is working to prevent anything untoward -- a large-scale political demonstration, for example -- from disrupting the games.\r\n\r\nThe real test, however, will come not in the summer of 2008, but in the year or two after all the visitors go home. How many of the changes in China\'s political system hinted at on the eve of the Olympics will actually be implemented? How much of the predictable Beijing spring of 2008 will last until 2009 or 2010?</blockquote>'

aS'The Tony Wilson Corollary.'
p252
aS'One of the more enduring lines from John Ford\'s Westerns is a maxim offered by Carleton Young in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVXuo2WiU_I" target="_blank">"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."</a> Young plays Maxwell Scott, an aging newspaper editor confronted with facts that contradict one his community\'s most cherished beliefs. Rather than print the ugly truth, he elects to destroy the evidence. His justification:\r\n<blockquote>This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.</blockquote>\r\nI thought of Young\'s line today while trolling the web for old video and news about Tony Wilson, the infamously impish founder of Factory Records who died this past week.\r\n\r\nOver on YouTube, I found a snippet from a television retrospective of his career. It focuses on his success promoting pathbreaking pop groups like The Sex Pistols, Joy Division, New Order and  The Happy Mondays.\r\n\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFndQ379ICw[/youtube]\r\n\r\nWhile there are some fun moments with the man himself, I was struck by how heavily the producers relied upon clips from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tca2JkjsZHU" target="_blank">"24 Hour Party People,"</a> the excellent biopic about Wilson starring Steve Coogan.\r\n\r\nNevermind that the movie was a work of fiction. Or that Coogan\'s version of Wilson is an unreliable narrator with a nearly pathological commitment to self-mythologizing. When a moment calls for video to illustrate qualities of Wilson\'s personality or events from his life, the producers jump for the legend more frequently than the fact.\r\n\r\nAnd, as much as this tweaks my inner journalism professor, I think I can understand where the TV producers were coming from. I\'ll try to offer it here as a 2007 update to Ford\'s maxim.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This is TV, stupid. When the tape is hot, run the tape.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tca2JkjsZHU[/youtube]'

p262
aS'A ritual stop on my regular tour of DC blogs is <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/">The Worldwide Standard</a>, an online outpost of the conservative magazine <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/default.asp" target="_blank">The Weekly Standard</a>.\r\n\r\nEven if you\'re not a DC newsjunkie, you\'ve probably come across TWS\'s editor, <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/aboutus/bio_kristol.asp" target="_blank">Bill Kristol</a>, at one time or another. He\'s on cable news all the time, serving as one of the Bush Administration\'s leading supporters.\r\n\r\nI like to follow the site\'s blog, which is tended by editor Michael Goldfarb and a team of bloggers, to keep tabs on conservative opinion. The content has an interesting focus on military matters, so it\'s also a good way to skim my way into what\'s going on in the circle of military bloggers ("milbloggers") that have bubbled up in Washington over the past couple of years.\r\n\r\nOne of the site\'s regular features is a post called "Required Reading" that provides a short list of links and maybe a picture or video.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2007/05/26/who-is-the-daily-muckiest/" target="_blank">a previous post I made</a> analyzing the links to online outlets offered by one of TWS\'s political opponents, I wrote a script this afternoon to fetch all of the TWS\'s "Required Reading" lists and add up what sources we\'ve been pointed to the most.\r\n\r\nIf you click <strong><a href="http://www.palewire.com/wp-content/uploads/standardurls.xls" target="_blank">here</a></strong>, you can download a spreadsheet ranking the different sources. It totals all the links from posts they\'ve <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/general/required_reading/" target="_blank">tagged as Required Reading</a>, which stretch back to February of this year.\r\n\r\nI\'ve eliminated all of the internal links to Weekly Standard\'s own material, so those aren\'t even in the running.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the list is the Washington Post, followed by a number of publications with a reputation for conservative editorializing. Fellow Rupert Murdoch properties, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal finish ahead of the NYTimes. And a number of military-oriented organizations, foreign policy wonks and blogs pepper the rest of the list. <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/" target="_blank">The national security blog at Wired</a> and <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/" target="_blank">BillRoggio.com</a> have been particularly popular.  You\'ll also find a couple regional newspapers and a few other oddballs. Unlike my previous study, there are, sadly, no referrals for my employer, <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/default.aspx">The Center for Public Integrity</a> (Hey, guys. You might like my <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/militaryaid/World.aspx" target="_blank">military aid database</a>!).\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Anything I screwed up? Overlooked?'

aS'One of my favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28music%29" target="_blank">mashup</a> producers, Mark Vidler, has apparently decided to call it quits. If you visit <a href="http://www.gohomeproductions.co.uk/">his Web site</a>, you\'ll find a free-to-download compilation of some of his more notable creations. I recommend checking it out.\r\n\r\nIn an email blast he sent out last week, Vidler suggested that he may go even further, posting an exhaustive collection of all his work online. I hope it happens. But, failing that, this set is a good retrospective. It includes some of my favorites ("The Weather Episode," "Shannon Stone"), though there are still some great tracks missing ("Jet Lady Joe").\r\n\r\nFive years or so after the online bootleg fad got going -- oh, <a href="http://boomselection.info/" target="_blank">boom selection</a>, we were once young! -- the novelty has certainly worn off. But I think Vidler\'s best work holds up well.\r\n\r\nA good Go Home Productions track is greater than the sum of its parts. When Vidler introduces hip-hop to a Rolling Stones riff, it doesn\'t feel like a campy gimmick (See: Girl Talk). It\'s as if a sort of pop vertigo has set in and you\'ve hallucinated your way into an alternative universe.\r\n\r\nI think that\'s largely due to Vidler\'s skill at songcraft, something you don\'t hear often accredited to pop artists who build their work from other musicians\' primary materials. Cut and paste may be easy, but doing it this well ain\'t.'

I doubt many people are surprised to learn that SoCal carwashes offer low wage jobs to Spanish speakers who may or may not be, to indulge in the parlance of our times, "documented." But it might still be a bit surprising to learn just how little many workers claim to be paid, regardless of where you stand on the immigration thing.\r\n<blockquote>From Santa Monica to Westwood to Koreatown, many workers said they received only tips for some or all of their shifts. Labor division inspectors estimated that about 10% to 20% of car dryers are not paid by owners."\r\n\r\nTips only" is a requirement for some new workers until owners are satisfied that they can properly dry a car, laborers said.</blockquote>\r\nBut, issues of newsworthiness and government regulation aside, the Times story is interesting to me for a different reason. Included in <a href="http://www.palewire.com/images/carwash-front.JPG" target="_blank">the online package</a> that accompanies the paper\'s effort is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-meweb-carwashero23mar23,0,2060590.story" target="_blank">a Spanish language translation</a>, also published on the Web site\'s front. Take a look.\r\n<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/carwash-front-zoom.JPG" /></p>\r\nLast month a Times blog posted <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/02/mirthala-salina.html">a Spanish quote from the paper\'s sister publication</a>, Hoy, and took a little flack for it. So this certainly isn\'t the first time across this particular ford in the stream.\r\n\r\nBut I wonder what the response will be like to this.  Any thoughts? Is this the sort of thing a newspaper in a place like LA should be doing? If not, why not? And, if so, how can a Spanish language story here or there on a Web site that\'s primarily English be effective and reach an Spanish speaking audience?\r\n\r\nAnd I can\'t read Spanish, so I\'m unable to discern whether there are any significant differences between the two stories, but I\'d be curious to hear comparisons from people who can.'

aS'Pop quiz.\r\n\r\nName the controversial black pastor, once allied with a charismatic young presidential candidate, who called America the "greatest purveyor of violence in the world today," before decrying how, in a "madness" fed by the "immense profits of overseas investment," the country "poisoned the international atmosphere" by falling "victim to ... deadly Western arrogance" and propping up a foreign government that is "singularly corrupt, inept and without popular support?" He\'s also noted concern about America worshipping "the God of Hate" at "the alter of retaliation."\r\n\r\nMaybe you\'re thinking of <a href="http://www.tucc.org/pastor.htm">Jeremiah Wright</a>, the Chicago pastor whose provocative sermons have recently caused problems for his highest profile congregant, presidential contender Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nWell, that\'s wrong. The answer is Martin Luther King Jr., who said all of those things in an April 1967 speech in Riverside, California. You can read and listen to it <a href="http://www.aavw.org/special_features/speeches_speech_king01.html" target="_blank">here</a>.\r\n\r\nNow you can start drawing distinctions between King\'s form of dissent and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPjVp3PLnVs&amp;feature=related">the more highly publicized snippets of Wright\'s technique</a>.  And that\'s fine. I could make a list myself. But my point here is that King wasn\'t always the meek and mild voice he\'s often portrayed to be today. Though I think the way forward pointed to by King, and <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/03/19/all-talk/">echoed again last week by Obama</a>, is still well captured by <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Hughes-America-Again1938.htm" target="_blank">the voice of Langston Hughes</a>, who, grievanced as he was, envisioned the possibility of a more perfect union to come:\r\n<blockquote>O, yes, I say it plain, America never was America to me, And yet I swear this oath-- America will be!</blockquote>'

Passport files do not contain travel information, such as visa and entry stamps, from previous passports. Almost all passport files contain only a passport application form as completed by the applicant.</blockquote>\r\nAnd, according to Under Secretary of State for Management <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdosfan.lib.uic.edu%2FERC%2Fbiographies%2Fkennedy.html&amp;ei=PLDnR6PfM52ypgTrr_2YBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcxZqkgvTu4fPWL8YrDbzc6h_uZA&amp;sig2=-VkRTRLCD5lRQYg_RvD2Vw" target="_blank">Patrick F. Kennedy</a>, here\'s what the paper trail looks like.\r\n<blockquote>When you send in your passport application, it might go to a State Department office around the country, it might go to a clerk of the court, it might go to a library or a post office. That information is -- your application is assembled with others and transmitted via registered mail, via Federal Express -- all of it is traceable -- to one of our facilities, a facility such as the one that we work with the Department of the Treasury on in Newark, Delaware . And the information then is -- the envelopes are opened, the checks are removed so that they can be deposited to the Treasury\'s account, and then they are processed for onward transmission to one of the State Department\'s facilities that actually print out the passport books in your name (<a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/coffee/102504.htm">Source</a>).</blockquote>\r\nIf you review <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100004.pdf" target="_blank">the passport application form</a>, you\'re not going to find much more than what\'s printed on your driver\'s license. At first blush, that hardly seems like the sort of thing that contains much to get excited about.\r\n\r\nBut, being good paranoids, we should be sure to note the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word">weasel words</a> in the State Department\'s blog post. They are "generally" and "almost all," which I can only take to mean that while most passport files may only contain the application form, some files contain other documents. What documents those are, it doesn\'t say.\r\n\r\nOn <a href="&amp;eurl=http://dandelionsalad.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/olbermann-obamas-passport-breach/" target="_blank">this particularly alarmist segment of The Countdown with Keith Olbermann</a>, the host and his guests seem to think there\'s the potential for quite a lot more to be in there. (In a memorable bit of hype, Keith speculates that the file might be of "Watergatian" proportions). On the other hand, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1724759,00.html?imw=Y" target="_blank">the reporting of Time\'s Brian Bennett</a> seems more in line with the State Department\'s blog.\r\n\r\nBut hell if I know.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that we live in a free country, governed by laws, one of the best of which is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gwu.edu%2F~nsarchiv%2Fnsa%2Ffoia.html&amp;ei=zK3nR__WB4WIpATamp2ZBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNETE0mlrhsTBkE-4Y0vG6jSlWdzvQ&amp;sig2=QGJ-0STQGz92YeZ3wRFlvw" target="_blank">the Freedom of Information Act</a> (a.k.a FOIA). And, thereby, we all have the right to review government documents pertaining to ourselves.\r\n\r\nSo, getting to the bottom of this should only be a matter of paperwork and collective effort. Below is a form letter I\'ve prepared using<a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86672.pdf"> the State Department\'s FOIA handbook</a> as a guide. I\'ve already filled in my own information and will, later today, mail it off as a formal request.\r\n\r\nYou should feel free to do the same. Just don\'t expect a rapid response. <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100129.pdf" target="_blank">The State Department annual report</a> says the median response time on a typical request last year was 212 days. (Though, if you\'re willing to pay a little more money, the State Department\'s manual suggests you might get your documents quicker if you bypass FOIA law and make your document request with <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport" target="_blank">the Passport Services office</a>.)\r\n\r\nIf you want to share what you get back, drop a comment when the time comes. I\'ll be sure to do the same.\r\n<blockquote>[Today\'s Date]\r\n\r\n[Your Name]\r\n[Your Street Address]\r\n[Your City, State and Zipcode]\r\n\r\nOffice of Information Programs and Services\r\n\r\nA/ISS/IPS\r\nDepartment of State, SA-2\r\nWashington, DC 20522-8001\r\nRe: Freedom of Information Act Request\r\n\r\nDear Sir or Madame:\r\n\r\nI am writing to request the release of personal records under the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\nI, [Your Name], born [Your Place of Birth] on [Your Date of Birth], request the release of any and all documents contained in my passport file.

Who are they? Hack reporters like me, picking up computer skills in a continuing quest to better sift, organize and analyze information. And, in the process, maybe keep our jobs.\r\n\r\nThere are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.diveintopython.org%2F&amp;ei=soD3R9zRI4_SpgSlvrGXAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQNAs7-XfPQXeZePlQKHmTA13dJQ&amp;sig2=STTYEjUUr__P0LCYzugcqA">a</a> <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">couple</a> great books available free online but it\'s pretty tough to start stringing all the fundamentals into a problem-solving script all on your own. So why not write up some simple recipes that attack problems common to our particular tribe?\r\n\r\nOne of the ways computer programming can be of great use to a reporter is as a text parser. We all have more documents than we have time.  So a common challenge is training your computer to read through a big blob of text and return any hits on terms you\'re interested in (i.e. the name of the mayor, a popular pesticide, a roster of local police officers).\r\n\r\nIf it\'s a one-off effort, you can probably get this done quickly using search tools included in common quality text editors (ex. <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">Ultraedit,</a> <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>). But if you\'ve got a steady stream of files, like a weekly dump of court filings, or a really big bad file, sometimes it\'s preferable to train your computer to do the work for you.\r\n\r\nIn that spirit, the following instructions are designed to show you how to use Python to search through a text file (The Sonnets of William Shakespeare), find any lines that contain our sample search term ("love"), and then print out the hits into a new file we can keep as a memento.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll be dealing with a source file that\'s probably cleaner than most documents you\'ll get from the government, and certainly a lot tidier than anything you\'ve converted from a PDF file using an <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOCR&amp;ei=Don3R6TqA5OkpwTwr-B-&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMFPblFGTHSM76WDSX2SkNbxkqaQ&amp;sig2=uwlPh0CUVchwL5Hp_rDZ4Q">OCR</a> application, but if you\'re a totally newbie, my hope is that this can help you get a grip on how the hell all the pieces described in the textbooks fit together into something almost useful.\r\n\r\nSince I\'m now a full-time geek, I do most of my work on computers that run some flavor of Linux. The step-by-step instructions that follow will walk you through each keystroke on the command line in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUbuntu_(Linux_distribution)&amp;ei=t4j3R8z6IKi-pgSXhtF3&amp;usg=AFQjCNEm1W3O1_OsDnkAl5emlxHmgPxPAQ&amp;sig2=f8zSJLp9T0AquKr-oWMTPg">Ubuntu</a>, which is what I run at home. But since most people who might be interested in this are probably running Windows XP or Mac OS X, I\'ll try to include translations as we go.\r\n\r\nThe one prerequsite for the whole endeavor is that you already have a working installation of Python. If you\'re working in Windows and you don\'t, I\'d recommend visiting <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/">ActiveState</a> and downloading the installer for their ActivePython distribution. If you\'re rocking a Macbook, you can find out whether you\'re rolling with Python by opening your terminal and entering the following:\r\n<pre lang="Bash">which python</pre>\r\nIf you\'ve got it properly installed, it should return something like\r\n<pre lang="Bash">/usr/bin/python</pre>\r\nIf it\'s not working out, I\'d recommend <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/installing_python/index.html">the installation instructions</a> in Mark Pilgrim\'s excellent book, Dive Into Python.\r\n\r\nAlright, with all that out of the way, let\'s get to the recipe.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Bash">cd $HOME\r\nmkdir Documents/py-search\r\ncd Documents/py-search</pre>\r\nThe three commands above, which should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux, will move us to our home directory, create a new subdirectory in your Documents folder, and relocate to the new folder.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re working in Windows, you\'ll be on the "C:/" file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might "mkdir" a new working directory in your "C:/TEMP" folder or wherever else you\'d like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and "cd" there after the fact through the command line.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Download our source file, The Sonnets of William Shakespeare.</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Bash">curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/wssnt10.txt</pre>\r\nThe line above uses the curl command line utility to download a copy of Shakespeare\'s work from the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gutenberg.org%2F&amp;ei=BI73R6_pPISmpwTs8qiGAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwWvhQCQqfxd5f1CbKz4kDmWOgtw&amp;sig2=zRLSSO5_tlJUa4Q_YjXXRQ">Project Gutenberg</a> Web site. Mac users with curl installed should be able to issue the same command. Windows users, or anyone without curl, will probably be able to most easily snatch the file just by visiting <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/wssnt10.txt">the link</a> in a web browser and saving the file to the working directory created in step one.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Bash">vim py-search.py</pre>\r\nThe line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=fI_3R7rdEIHUpgTsleWSAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=MmXWcI-I3tIW0vBQUWiXgA">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you\'re a newbie Windows user, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad">Notepad</a> should work great.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re following along in vim, you\'ll need to enter "insert mode" so you can start entering text.  Do that by hitting:\r\n<pre lang="Bash">i</pre>\r\n<strong>4. Write the code!</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="1" colla="+">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\nshakes = open("wssnt10.txt", "r")\r\n\r\nfor line in shakes:\r\n    if re.match("(.*)(L|l)ove(.*)", line):\r\n        print line,</pre>\r\nIf, like my friends, you\'ve been working through some common Python tutorials, I\'m guessing a lot of that looks familar to you.\r\n\r\nThe first line is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">"shebang"</a> that, on execution of the file, instructs the computer to process the script using the python interpreter. The "import re" pulls in <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-re.html">Python\'s standard regular expression module</a> so we can use it later to search the text. The open() command grabs the Shakespeare file we\'ve just downloaded and opens it up. The "r" is for read mode.\r\n\r\nThe three staggered statements that follow are a loop that runs through each line in the document, as dictated by the first statement. The second statement uses <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regular-expressions.info%2Fpython.html&amp;ei=qJT3R9GRFabopASVx7yOAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHl7XwdC7m3xt26uu6oInBwYX1lOw&amp;sig2=SgkINQJUbkJB1FIERp8qmw">the re.match() function</a> we imported at the top to evaluate the latest line on each iteration through the loop by testing it against that scary looking mess in its first parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, what is that thing? "(.*)(L|l)ove(.*)", say what?\r\n\r\nThat\'s a regular expression I designed specifically to catch any instances of the search term I\'m after.  If you\'re not familar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>, they\'re a powerful language for matching strings of text. When you first get started, they can be a bit intimidating, but once you learn a couple tricks, you\'ll quickly see how useful they can be. One of my favorite geek jokes is <a href="http://xkcd.com/208/">this cartoon</a> on the utility of a well-timed "regex"\r\n\r\nSo how does it work? There are two tricks to learn. Remember, our goal is to find any line in Shakespeare\'s sonnets that include the word love. But, when we think about it, we can\'t just search for "love" because our loop is evaluating the text line by line, not word by word. So if we just ask for "love," we\'d only get lines that include <em>only</em> the word "love." Plus the word could appear in any number of common grammatical variations (ex. "Love," "lover," "lovesick," "self-love") that we\'d also like to capture.\r\n\r\nThat\'s where the regular expressions come in. You\'ll notice that the expression is bracketed by two "(.*)" statements. In regular expression language, the "." command matches any string and the "*" repeats whatever command precedes it zero or more times, so together they will match any string of any length. When bracketed around a search term, like "love," it should return a match on a line of text regardless of where in the line "love" appears. In other words, it would match <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO9GB_KUAQI">"She loves you,"</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLv_VaTGxH0">"love is a many spendored thing"</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzB-3oKIfRw">"ain\'t talking \'bout love."</a>\r\n\r\nBut, all by itself "(.*)love(.*) wouldn\'t match <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrvNzH9aaUE">"America: What Time is Love?"</a> or  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50EALZU4D6A">"Love Is Only A Feeling."</a> Why not? Because those songs have an uppercase L and we\'re just asking for lowercase. Bummer, right?\r\n\r\nOne way to fix that would be to add an option that gives the regular expression variations on the term to look for. You can do that by adding another parenthesis set and separating the options with a "|" pipe. That\'s where the "(L|l)" above came from. Combine that with the (.*) commands and we should have a quick and dirty regex to catch the lines we\'re after. Though quick studies will catch a flaw in the design. As we\'ll see in our result set later, this sort of dragnet approach will also yield hits on things we might not want to catch, words like "glove" and "lovely" will match just as easily as "lovesick" or "lover." Feel free to tweak the statement and try to finetune your results. There\'s a ton more you can do with regular expressions than what I\'ve described. So don\'t take my example too seriously. I just wanted to show off a couple of the most common regex commands.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Save your script and run it.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you\'re working along with me in vim, you\'ll need to save your work before exiting. The easiest way to do that is to exit insert mode by hitting the ESC key and then hold SHIFT and hit the Z key twice in a row.  If you\'re working in your own text editor, just save it however you\'re comfortable.\r\n\r\nNow jump back onto the command line resting in your working directory and tell python to fire that mother off.\r\n<pre lang="Bash">python py-search.py</pre>\r\nVoila. There they are, flying across your screen is every line in Shakespeare\'s sonnets containing the word love. And if you wanted to print them out to a new text file, rather than just dump them on the screen, jump back into your script and try something more like this.\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="1" colla="+">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\nshakes = open("wssnt10.txt", "r")\r\n\r\nlove = open("love.txt", "w")\r\n\r\nfor line in shakes:\r\n    if re.match("(.*)(L|l)ove(.*)", line):\r\n        print >> love, line,</pre>\r\nNow just open love.txt and you should find the same results as before.\r\n\r\nThe only difference in this script is that we\'re now opening an outfile called love (notice that it\'s "w" mode, for write, rather than "r" mode like the source) and modifying our print line to kick the results there, instead of the console.\r\n\r\nThat\'s all folks. Per usual, if I\'ve screwed something up, or I\'m not being clear, just shoot me an email or drop a comment and we\'ll sort it out. Hope this is helpful to somebody.'

John McCain</a>, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, had been booed during a speech honoring Martin Luther King Jr. on the 40th anniversary of King\'s assassination.\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/N7SjvQvykNQ&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/N7SjvQvykNQ&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAs <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/15107.html">Steve Benen</a> <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/04/the-complicated.html">and others</a> have recorded, McCain has followed a serpentine path on the issue. And I\'m not sure I can clearly reconcile their accounts of the candidate\'s past actions with his current position.\r\n\r\nMLK holiday angst is hardly a new story in American politics (Remember <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39DJqI8puV0">Public Enemy\'s "By The Time I Get To Arizona"</a>). What caught my imagination this weekend for the first time was the possibility that we might be one day playing out an identical drama, but in a different color.\r\n\r\nLess than a week before the anniversary of King\'s death, another notable date passed. March 31 is the birthday of union organizer and Hispanic-American hero <a href="http://www.colapublib.org/chavez/bio.htm">Cesar Chavez</a>. With <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/stories/2008/02/06/08_latino_turnout_02060.html">Hispanic participation</a> in the Democratic party <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-latino17jan17,0,7713796.story">vaulting</a>, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/03/barack-obama-ca.html">Sen. Barack Obama took the opportunity</a> to make a point of supporting a national holiday, which dovetails with <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.res.00076:">a fledgling resolution in the House of Representatives</a> offering to make the same idea law. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.cesarchavezholiday.org/aboutus.html">an array of prominent union organizers</a> have signed on to the lobbying effort.\r\n\r\nIf the Democratic leadership ever brings the measure to a vote, I wonder if a \'Nay\' might one day come back to haunt a future presidential candidate, just as McCain\'s 1983 vote haunted him yesterday. Voting against Chavez Day might not be so politically beneficial four or five election cycles from now if you\'re running for president in an America where Hispanics are a larger, more affluent and more political active segment of the population.\r\n\r\nWhile it was a new thought for me -- living only blocks from Los Angeles\' Cesar Chavez Boulevard may be having an effect -- the concept of Hispanic demographics as destiny certainly occured to Chavez himself. In the course of kicking around the web this afternoon, I found the following passage from a 1984 Chavez speech that offers a strong prediction. You can read and listen to it <a href="http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/20thcentury/84-11chavez-audio.html">here</a>.\r\n<blockquote>I am told these days farm workers should be  discouraged and pessimistic. The Republicans control the governor\'s office and  the White House. There is a conservative trend in the nation. Yet, we are filled  with hope and encouragement. We have looked into the future and the future is  ours. History and inevitability are on our side. The farm workers and their  children and the Hispanics and their children are the future in California, and  corporate growers are the past. Those politicians who ally themselves with the  corporate growers and against farm workers and the Hispanics are in for a big  surprise. They want to make their careers in politics; they want to hold power  20 and 30 years from now. But 20 and 30 years from now, in Modesto, in Salinas,  in Fresno, in Bakersfield, in the Imperial Valley and in many of the great  cities of California, those communities will be dominated by farm workers and  not by growers, by the children and grandchildren of farm workers and not by the  children and grandchildren of growers.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nLike the other immigrant groups, the day will  come when we win the economic and political rewards, which are in keeping with  our numbers in society. The day will come when the politicians will do the right  thing for our people out of political necessity and not out of charity or  idealism. That day may not come this year. That day may not come during this  decade, but it will come someday. And when that day comes, we shall see the  fulfillment of that passage from the Book of Matthew in the New Testament: "The  last shall be first, and the first shall be last." And on that day, our nation  shall fulfill its creed, and that fulfillment shall enrich us all. Thank you  very much.</blockquote>\r\nIt\'s a little eerie how closely it mirrors <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP-DsxmbtGc&amp;feature=related">MLK\'s famous last speech in Memphis</a>, but with a stronger nod to the virtues of bare-knucked, union-style politics than King\'s offer of divine revelation. What do you think of the comparison?'

aS'Python Recipe: Open multiple files, search for matches, count your hits.'
p372
aS'I got some feedback from our beginners on the <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/">Python recipe</a> I put up yesterday. They had a couple good questions about ways they can branch off, which I think we can cover pretty quick in another post.\r\n\r\nTo recap, Saturday\'s script opened a single file (Shakespeare\'s sonnets), searched the text line by line for a search term ("love") using a basic regular expression, and  then closed by printing the hits to a new text file. Today\'s recipe will do all that, and a couple other things that might be helpful.\r\n\r\nFor reason\'s discussed in my previous post, I think munching through text with Python is going to be most useful for a reporter when she can leverage its power against large bodies of text.  Our first example only operated on a single file. Out there in the real world, with deadlines, diets and kids to pick up at soccer practice, why should we invest the time learning to write a computer script to process a single file when we might be able to hack out the job with CTRL-F and just be done with it?\r\n\r\nI feel that.\r\n\r\nSo, let\'s take the next step. Let\'s learn how to crack open a whole directory full of files and slam each one through our wood chipper.\r\n\r\nBut before we get going, let me just say that I\'m going to assume you read <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/">yesterday\'s recipe</a> and won\'t be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>. I\'ll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn\'t work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We\'ll iron it out.\r\n\r\nFormalities aside, here the example task I\'ve selected to achieve our mission.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Download the works of Friedrich Nietzsche.</li>\r\n\t<li>Train our computer to open the books one by one.</li>\r\n\t<li>Read through the text of each.</li>\r\n\t<li>Find all the lines that contain the german word for hate (<em>hasse</em>, <em>hasst</em>, <em>hassen</em>)</li>\r\n\t<li>Print out the hits.</li>\r\n\t<li>Count up the totals for each book and figure which one is the hatenest (<em>das meisten hassten!</em>).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSound good? Let\'s do it.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Bash">cd $HOME/Documents\r\nmkdir py-search-multiple-files\r\ncd py-search-multiple-files/\r\nmkdir nietzsche</pre>\r\nWe\'re going to start the same way we did yesterday, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line. The only difference this time is that we\'re making an additional subdirectory to hold the source files we\'ll be searching.\r\n\r\nThe commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re working in Windows, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be on the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93C:/\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93mkdir\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d a new working directory in your \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93C:/TEMP\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d folder or wherever else you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93cd\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d there after the fact through the command line.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Download our source files, the works of Friedrich Nietzsche.</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/n#a779">visit Project Gutenberg</a>, you can find variety of Nietzsche\'s work available for download. For our purposes, we\'re going to take all of the books available there printed in the author\'s native tongue, German. We could point and click our way through the process -- visiting each book\'s profile page and downloading its text to our new nietzsche folder -- but if your aim is to become a big-time computer nerd, you might be interested in a command-line trick that can pull them all down with a single line of code.\r\n\r\nYesterday we used the curl utility to pull down our Shakespeare file. If you pulled that off, I\'m sure you can easily imagine how it could be replicated with each of today\'s files, provided that you know the right urls to hit. And I\'m guessing it might look something like this.\r\n<pre lang="Bash">curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7zara10.txt\r\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7ecce10.txt\r\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7gbrt10.txt\r\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7gtzn10.txt\r\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7jnst10.txt\r\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7msch10.txt</pre>\r\nBut, man, that hardly seems easier that clicking around, does it? Thankfully, one of the great things you pick up as you learn your way around the command line is that there\'s almost always a way to trim down a repetitive task into an elegant, simple string of code. Here\'s how those six separate curls can be combined.\r\n<pre lang="Bash">cd nietzsche\r\ncurl -O "http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7{zara,ecce,gbrt,gtzn,jnst,msch}10.txt"\r\ncd ..</pre>\r\nRemember how we used the (L|l) option statement in our regular expression yesterday to match our search pattern to phrases containing either an upper or lowercase \'L\'? We can do a similar thing here with curl, reducing the six urls to their common parts and providing a list of options between the {}\'s where we plug each link\'s unique string. We just use "cd" to commute down to our subdirectory and back. For more details on how curl works, try typing in\r\n<pre lang="Bash">curl --help</pre>\r\nor\r\n<pre lang="Bash">curl --man</pre>\r\nEach should include instructions on all other sorts of crazy tricks you can pull off. And if you have something in mind, don\'t forget to ask <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=bH6&amp;q=curl+tricks+linux&amp;btnG=Search">our good friend Google</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you can\'t get curl to work on your system, but you still want to play along, just go ahead and download the Nietzsche files one by one through your web browser. As long as you put them in the subdirectory we named after him, the stuff that follows should still work just fine.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Bash">vim search.py</pre>\r\nThe line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview (\'/outbound/www.google.com\');" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=fI_3R7rdEIHUpgTsleWSAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=MmXWcI-I3tIW0vBQUWiXgA">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re a newbie Windows user, <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview (\'/outbound/en.wikipedia.org\');" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad">Notepad</a> should work great.\r\n\r\nIf you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re following along in vim, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll need to enter \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93insert mode\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d so you can start entering text.  Do that by hitting:\r\n<pre lang="Bash">i</pre>\r\n<strong>4. Write the code!</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="1" colla="+">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nimport re, os\r\n\r\npath = "./nietzsche"\r\nfreddys_library = os.listdir(path)\r\n\r\nfor book in freddys_library:\r\n    file = os.path.join(path, book)\r\n    text = open(file, "r")\r\n\r\n        for line in text:\r\n            if re.match("(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)", line):\r\n                print line,</pre>\r\nHere\'s what we\'ll start with. If you cover up the top part of the script with your hand, you\'ll see that the three statements at the end look almost identical to what we wrote in the first lesson. The script iterates through each line in a file (in this case dubbed "text"), seeks out a match using the same methods described in detail yesterday, and then finally prints out cases where we find a hit.\r\n\r\nThe only major difference is that we\'ve replaced portions of yesterday\'s statement designed to seek out variations on the word "love" with another quick-fix regex designed to net the common German forms of the word hate (<em>hasse</em>, <em>hasst,</em> <em>hassen</em>).\r\n\r\nAnd then we\'ve got all that junk up there above it. What\'s going on there?\r\n\r\nThe first thing to notice is that we added another module to the import statement. In addition to the "re" module we\'re using to match regular expressions, we\'ve also introduced the "<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-os.html">os" module</a>. The os library hooks you up with a bunch of easy ways to pull in basic information about your operating system and file structure for use in Python. Our next two statements put it to use right away. First we store our nietzsche subdirectory in a variable called "path," which is then passed to the os function listdir(). That will return a list of all the files contained within the directory. Regardless of how few, or how many, are stuffed down in there, the filenames will now all be stored in our second variable, "freddys_library."\r\n\r\nOur next step is to open up a loop that will iterate through each file name in "freddys_library." Since the function simply returns each file\'s name, not its path, we have to link the two before we can open the file. So the first step is another os function brought in to meld the two. Then we\'re free to open the file the same way we did yesterday, which leads the way to the search-and-print loop we\'re already familar with. And since it\'s stored within the loop stepping through each book\'s file, it will be repeated for every title before the script ends.\r\n\r\nNow save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line...\r\n<pre lang="Bash" line="1" colla="+">python py-search.py</pre>\r\n...and, voila, you should now have every line in Nietzsche that contains the word hate flying by on your screen.\r\n\r\nNow here\'s the next set of tricks.\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="1" colla="+">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nimport re, os\r\n\r\npath = "./nietzsche"\r\nfreddys_library = os.listdir(path)\r\n\r\nhate = open("hate.txt", "w")\r\n\r\nfor book in freddys_library:\r\n    file = os.path.join(path, book)\r\n    text = open(file, "r")\r\n\r\n    hit_count = 0\r\n    for line in text:\r\n        if re.match("(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)", line):\r\n            hit_count = hit_count + 1\r\n            print >>  hate, book + "|" + line,\r\n\r\n    print book + " => " + str(hit_count)\r\n    text.close()</pre>\r\nThis second snippet is identical to our first draft, with a few additions. The simplest change is first, to create a new file ("hate.txt") where our matches are now printed. You\'ll notice that the print statement has also been modified to output the book\'s file name and a pipe-delimiter along with each hit on hate. So each line in your out file should be labeled with the source file where it was found.\r\n\r\nThe second change is to introduce a new "hit_count" variable designed to keep a running count of the matches found in each book and report back the results. Since it\'s enclosed within the outer loop, the first "hit_count = 0" variable will reset the number to nil on each book\'s iteration. And then the placement of "hit_count + 1" within the subsequent if statement will click the variable\'s total up one each time a match is made and the interpreter runs through that portion of the script. The final touch is to close each run through the loop by printing the book\'s file name along with the total number of hits found after all of the lines had been evaluated. The number is enclosed in a str() function so that it\'s converted from an integer into a string, which can be easily concatenated with other strings for our print statement.\r\n\r\nWhen you run version two, it\'ll now print out the total number of hits for each book, looking something like this:\r\n<pre lang="Bash">7msch10.txt => 13\r\n7zara10.txt => 34\r\n7ecce10.txt => 2\r\n7gtzn10.txt => 5\r\n7gbrt10.txt => 2\r\n7jnst10.txt => 4</pre>\r\nIt works, but it\'s pretty ugly. How can you tell the different books apart without memorizing their file names? Good thing we can fix that too. Check out how.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="1" colla="+">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nimport re, os\r\n\r\ntitle = {\r\n    "7ecce10.txt": "Ecce homo, Wie man wird, was man",\r\n    "7gtzn10.txt": "Gotzen-Dammerung",\r\n    "7msch10.txt": "Menschliches, Allzumenschliches",\r\n    "7gbrt10.txt": "Die Geburt der Tragodie",\r\n    "7jnst10.txt": "Jenseits von Gut und Bose",\r\n    "7zara10.txt": "Also sprach Zarathustra"\r\n}\r\n\r\npath = "./nietzsche"\r\nfreddys_library = os.listdir(path)\r\n\r\nhate = open("hate.txt", "w")\r\n\r\nfor book in freddys_library:\r\n    file = os.path.join(path, book)\r\n    text = open(file, "r")\r\n\r\n    hit_count = 0\r\n    for line in text:\r\n        if re.match("(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)", line):\r\n            hit_count = hit_count + 1\r\n            print >>  hate, title[book] + "|" + line,\r\n\r\n    print title[book] + " => " + str(hit_count)\r\n    text.close()</pre>\r\n\r\nAfter referring back to our text files to figure out which files contain which books, I made the Python "dictionary" at the top of this snippet. It pairs up the files with the titles for later reference, which happens easy peasy there at bottom when the loop\'s current "book" variable is run against the dictionary to return its title for our output.\r\n\r\nNow if you save your changes and fire it off again, you should be getting something more like this:\r\n<pre lang="Bash">Menschliches, Allzumenschliches => 13\r\nAlso sprach Zarathustra => 34\r\nEcce homo, Wie man wird, was man => 2\r\nGotzen-Dammerung => 5\r\nDie Geburt der Tragodie => 2\r\nJenseits von Gut und Bose => 4</pre>\r\nMuch nicer, nein?\r\n\r\nAlright. That\'s all for tonight. I hope this helps y\'all kick the can a little further down the road. Per usual, if I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve screwed something up, or I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not being clear, just shoot me an email or drop a comment and we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll sort it out. Hope this is helpful to somebody.'

aS'There\'s a great nugget buried in the back of <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2008/Mapping_Irans_Online_Public">the Berkman Center\'s new study</a> on the Iranian blogosphere. I\'m sure their <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2008/Mapping_Irans_Online_Public/Iranian_blogosphere_map">awesome social networking diagram</a> is going to rack up hits across the Western Web this week, and deservedly so, but what I\'m really taken with is their ranking of Iran\'s most highly cited YouTube videos (as of Feb. 2008). The study\'s general finding is that Iran\'s blogosphere has a fairly diverse set of views, but they mention that expatriates and secular reformers tend to link in YouTube more often than conservos. Their methodology for the study (and, presumably, the ranking) is at the bottom. But, first, let\'s get those mothers out the pdf and onto the Web, where they belong.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Against Capital Punishment\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9dAgainst the Islamic Regime\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/GtkM2Vx_oGY&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/GtkM2Vx_oGY&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>09. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Mansour Osanloo - Freedom Will Come\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/in-vF2LvITk&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/in-vF2LvITk&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>08. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Iran ey Sara e Omid\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2hWS3gvvLJI&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2hWS3gvvLJI&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>07. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Mohsen Namjoo\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MUnhQOZcqE0&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MUnhQOZcqE0&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>06. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Nazeri\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/t3KRHF0_2WU&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/t3KRHF0_2WU&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>05. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Crack in Iran\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d </strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_Lw5UekabhI&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_Lw5UekabhI&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>04. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Holy Crime\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9R5oLZ8TnWs&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9R5oLZ8TnWs&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>03. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93A girl with a childish voice\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/40mvtRJBEnA&amp;hl=en" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/40mvtRJBEnA&amp;hl=en" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n<strong>02. \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Akhoond\'s (Cleric) Comment on Girls.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d</strong>\r\n\r\nPRIVATE!

aS'Python Recipe: Read a file, search for a pattern, print your matches.'
p397
aS'Our <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/">first</a> <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/07/python-recipe-open-multiple-files-search-for-matches-count-your-hits-on-the-fly/">two</a> recipes focused primarily on how to open one or more files and loop through them line by line. While we paid a little attention to how we could search for patterns using <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000310000000000000000">regular expressions</a>, we didn\'t try to do a whole lot with what we caught. Hell, we didn\'t even try very hard to write a good regex.\r\n\r\nBut when you start to get serious about searching for patterns in text, one of the obvious goals is to single out and collect your matches. Maybe you want to pull all the phone numbers out of big blobs of text. Or email addresses. Or anything enclosed in quotation marks. Whatever.\r\n\r\nHere\'s one way to try it.\r\n\r\nBut before we get going, let me just say that I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m going to assume you read the first couple recipes and won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a>. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll iron it out.\r\n\r\nFormalities aside, here\'s the example task I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve selected to achieve our mission.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Download the King James Version of the Holy Bible.</li>\r\n\t<li>Read through each line of text.</li>\r\n\t<li>Capture each four-letter word.</li>\r\n\t<li>Print them out.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nLet\'s do it.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</strong>\r\nWe\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going to start the same way we did in the first two lessons, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line. \r\n\r\n<pre lang="bash">cd Documents/\r\nmkdir py-search-and-capture\r\ncd py-search-and-capture/</pre>\r\n\r\nThe commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re working in Windows, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be on the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93C:/\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93mkdir\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d a new working directory in your \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93C:/TEMP\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d folder or wherever else you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93cd\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d there after the fact through the command line.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Download our source file, The King James Version of the Holy Bible</strong>\r\n\r\nWe\'re going to use <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10">the text file</a> provided Project Gutenberg as our source. As in the earlier lessons, I\'m going to use the curl command-line utility to retrieve the file, but you should feel free to download it to our working directory using your web browser, if you prefer.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="bash">curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext90/kjv10.txt</pre>\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</strong>\r\n\r\n<pre lang="bash">vim search.py</pre>\r\n\r\nThe line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&ei=uzoESIj8LKnmpgTRy43VBw&usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&sig2=vP2XqMTTDBFF49Gy22gxJQ">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re a newbie Windows user, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNotepad&ei=zToESKWNL4uqpwT2k73dBw&usg=AFQjCNEXWgXDcow8vXjueJBIOmWghv1lhw&sig2=aDintKlEbbRHHWcaHXoz1w">Notepad</a> should work great.\r\n\r\nIf you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re following along in vim, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll need to enter \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93insert mode\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d so you can start entering text. Do that by hitting:\r\n\r\n<pre lang="bash">i</pre>\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Write the code!</strong>\r\n\r\n<pre lang="python">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\nbible = open("kjv10.txt", "r")\r\n\r\nregex = re.compile(r\'\\b\\w{4}\\b\')\r\n\r\nfor line in bible:\r\n    four_letter_words = regex.findall(line)\r\n    for word in four_letter_words:\r\n        print word\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nOur file opens by importing the re module, which will allow us to call upon Python\'s regular expression library. We then open our Bible into a variable of the same name and, as in previous recipes, open a loop that will iterate through each line in the file.\r\n\r\nThe new stuff comes next. The first statement above our loop uses re\'s compile method to store our regular expression pattern into a variable called "regex." (As commenter Paddy suggested <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/#comment-73091">below</a>, it\'s a good idea to put it above the loop so it doesn\'t have to be repeated on each iteration.) Remember, our goal is to match any four-letter words. There are three regex symbols I squished together to give it a hack. They are defined as follows. I\'ve drawn the definitions from <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000310000000000000000">this</a> Python reference, which can probably help you crack most nuts.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\\b - Word boundary. This is a zero-width assertion that matches only at the beginning or end of a word.</li>\r\n\t<li>\\w - Matches any alphanumeric character</li>\r\n\t<li>{m,n} - There must be at least m repetitions, and at most n.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo when you piece them together like so, "\\b\\w{4}\\b", what you\'re asking for is any stretch of four alphanumeric characters between two word boundaries. Make sense?\r\n\r\nNext, equipped with our regex, we create another variable called "four_letter_words." In it we see our regex variable pressed against a re method we haven\'t used before. In the previous lessons we used the kludgy match() function to make our hits. Here we\'re using something more elegant. It\'s findall(), which will return all the matches within our line as a list. And by connecting it to our pre-compiled "regex" variable, we\'re setting that as the pattern it should look for. \r\n\r\nWe can expect plenty of lines with more than one match, so we\'ll set up another loop to run through "four_letter_words" and print out all the hits. And then we\'re done. Save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6\r\n<pre lang="bash">python py-search.py</pre>\r\nAnd, voila, there you have it.

I had a light bulb go on in the first couple scenes when I realized that <a href="http://www.myspace.com/johnnyboyuk">one of my favorite one-hit wonders</a> from the 2000s took their name from DeNiro\'s character, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mF1tj2bq80">the self-destructive Johnny Boy</a>.

aS'I\'ve got nothing but love for my <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faddons.mozilla.org%2Ffirefox%2Faddon%2F424&amp;ei=sGUKSPKoNormiAGc5_X7Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRuvtWF_V2hBapD8LoyLZwii58dg&amp;sig2=2FuOYh3EftJCYVLcRqGXKg">Wizz RSS</a> reader. But sometimes it\'s still not enough to keep up. The more feeds I add, the clunkier it gets to click my way down through the list. And I find myself lazing out and only reading about half as much as I should.\r\n\r\nSo, in an effort to help myself better keep up on what\'s going on, I\'ve put together <a href="http://news.palewire.com/">news.palewire.com</a>, a feed aggregator that blends together the mix of pundits, blogs, delicious feeds and gossip sheets that I dig on. The topics tend toward newspapers (plight of), data analysis and news media geekery. It\'s all brought together using Sam Ruby\'s excellent, Python-based <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.intertwingly.net%2Fcode%2Fvenus%2F&amp;ei=3WUKSKnGL6WSiAGt8Kj8Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNFP_934Ze7RW9xxy00jKqh-MH8TJQ&amp;sig2=AlUI-qFbEu2WluntfxQTxQ">Planet Venus</a> application, which I previously used to assemble <a href="http://www.shawington.com/">Shawington.com</a>.

aS'Python Recipe: Grab a page, scrape a table, download a file.'
p417
aS'Here\'s a change of pace. Our <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/">first</a> <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/07/python-recipe-open-multiple-files-search-for-matches-count-your-hits-on-the-fly/">few</a> <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/">lessons</a> focused on how you can use Python to goof with a bunch of local files. This time we\'re going to try something different: using Python to go online and screw around with the Web. \r\n\r\nWhenever I caucus with aspiring <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicar.org%2F&ei=1HYLSJWzII6IiwGuhvj7Ag&usg=AFQjCNFv1OMXDU_2U5mOn6I-DfJcHnfT7Q&sig2=PRhstdzVRiSElCZCCA9pQA">NICARians</a> and other data hungry reporters, it\'s not long before the topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a> comes up. While automated text processing and database management may sound well and good, there\'s something sexy about pulling down a fatty government database that catches people\'s imagination and inspires them to take on the challenge of learning a new programming language. Or at least entertain the idea until they run into a road block.\r\n\r\nA number of fellow travelers do a noble job instructing people on the basics during NICAR\'s annual seminars. But scraping seems like such a sought-after skill that it feels like a good idea to throw up a basic walkthrough here, where beginners can cut and paste code and any feedback can be memorialized. \r\n\r\nBut before we get going, let me just say that I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m going to assume you read the first couple recipes and won\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs Ubuntu Linux. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll iron it out.\r\n\r\nFormalities aside, here\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s the example task I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ve selected to achieve our mission.\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Install the necessary Python modules, mechanize and Beautiful Soup.</li>\r\n\t<li>Train our computer to visit Ben\'s list of <a href="http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html">The Greatest Albums in the History of 2007</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Parse the html and scrape out Ben\'s rankings.</li>\r\n\t<li>Click through to Ben\'s list of <a href="http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2006.html">The Greatest Albums in the History of 2006</a> and repeat the scrape.</li>\r\n        <li>Do it all over again, but this time download the cover art.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Download the mechanize and Beautiful Soup modules. Install them. </strong>\r\n\r\nThere are a dozen different methods for going about our task, so you shouldn\'t assume the one I\'m about to show you is the only or the best. It\'s just one way to do it. And doing it this way requires a couple additions to your Python installation, which might seem a little daunting but should be doable unless IT has your computer on double secret probation. \r\n\r\nA <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.0.1/tut/node8.html">module</a> is a collection of functions, defintions and statements contained in a separate file that you can import into your script. Examples native to Python used in our earlier scripts included "re", "os" and "string." \r\n\r\nOut there on the Web, kind and ambitious programmers are constantly drafting, updating and publishing new modules to boil down complicated tasks into simpler forms. It it wasn\'t for these people, praise be upon them, I probably wouldn\'t have a job. \r\n\r\nIf you want to take advantage of their contributions, you need to plug their creations into your local Python installation. It\'s usually not that hard, even on Windows!\r\n\r\nTo accomplish today\'s task, we\'re going to rely on two third-party modules. The first is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwwwsearch.sourceforge.net%2Fmechanize%2F&ei=WokLSJr3A52qiAHS6L38Ag&usg=AFQjCNGUEUs6Jn1FSoo0YYjpZ2PJe6E6Ag&sig2=I3rdoLQ5AV843Eignvjxgg">mechanize</a>, a Python translation of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.cpan.org%2Fdist%2FWWW-Mechanize%2F&ei=gIkLSOmaMY-ShAOc38TDAw&usg=AFQjCNEsooTEHj6bN2UHDi0OfZ2krEX-EA&sig2=zPl5yUdSVr0loDl4qaaUYQ">the popular Perl module</a> for calling up and walking through Web pages. The second is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crummy.com%2Fsoftware%2FBeautifulSoup%2F&ei=tIkLSITRIYjGigHqmez7Ag&usg=AFQjCNHAxwplurFOBqg5cehWQEVKi-TuLQ&sig2=UhVMcFqeJrnKIp2wIF5t6g">Beautiful Soup</a>, a superlatively elegant means for parsing HTML and XML documents. Working hand-in-hand, they can accomplish most simple web scrapes.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re working Linux or Mac OS X, this is going to be a piece of cake. All you need is to use Python\'s auto-installer <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">Easy Install</a> to issue the following commands:\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">sudo easy_install mechanize\r\nsudo easy_install BeautifulSoup</pre>\r\n\r\nAnd now you can check if the modules are available for use by cracking open your python interpreter...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">python</pre>\r\n\r\n...and attempting to import the new modules...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">\r\nfrom mechanize import Browser\r\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf the interpreter accepts the commands and kicks down the next line without an error, you know you\'re okay. If it throws an error, you know something is off. \r\n\r\nI don\'t have a lot of Python experience working in Windows, but the method for adding modules that I\'ve had success with is simply downloading the .py files to my desktop and dumping them in the "lib" folder of my Python installation. If, like me, you use Activestate\'s <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/?_x=1">ActivePython</a> distribution for Windows, it should be easily found at C:/Python25/lib/. And when you browse around the directory, you should already see os.py, re.py and other modules we\'re already familar with. So just visit the <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/">mechanize</a> and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> homepages and retrieve the latest download. Dump the .py files in your lib folder and now you should be able to fire up your python interpreter just the same as above and introduce yourself to our new friends.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, we now have all the tools we need to grip and rip. So let\'s do it!\r\n\r\n<b>2. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</b>\r\n\r\nWe\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re going to start the same way we did in the first three lessons, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">cd Documents/\r\nmkdir py-scrape-and-download\r\ncd py-scrape-and-download/</pre>\r\n\r\nThe commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re working in Windows, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll be on the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93C:/\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93mkdir\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d a new working directory in your \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93C:/TEMP\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d folder or wherever else you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93cd\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d there after the fact through the command line.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</strong>\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">vim py-scrape-and-download.py</pre>\r\n\r\nThe line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&ei=uzoESIj8LKnmpgTRy43VBw&usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&sig2=vP2XqMTTDBFF49Gy22gxJQ">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re a newbie Windows user, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNotepad&ei=zToESKWNL4uqpwT2k73dBw&usg=AFQjCNEXWgXDcow8vXjueJBIOmWghv1lhw&sig2=aDintKlEbbRHHWcaHXoz1w">Notepad</a> should work great.\r\n\r\nIf you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re following along in vim, you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll need to enter \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93insert mode\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d so you can start entering text. Do that by hitting:\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">i</pre>\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Write the code!</strong>\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nfrom mechanize import Browser\r\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\r\n\r\nmech = Browser()\r\n\r\nurl = "http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html"\r\npage = mech.open(url)\r\n\r\nhtml = page.read()\r\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html)\r\n\r\nprint soup.prettify()</pre>\r\n\r\nOur first snippet of code, seen above, shows a basic introduction to each of our new modules.\r\n\r\nAfter they\'ve been imported in lines two and three, we put mechanize\'s browser to use right away, storing it a variable I\'ve decided to call mech, but which you could call anything you wanted (ex. browser, br, ie, whatever). We then use its open() method to grab the location of our first scrape target, <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/">my favorite albums of 2007</a>, and store that in another variable we\'ll call page. \r\n\r\nThat\'s enough to go out on the web and grab the page, now we need to tell Python what to do with it. Mechanize\'s read() method will return all of the HTML in the page, which we store, simply, in an variable called html and then pass to BeautifulSoup\'s default method so it can be prepared for processing.\r\n\r\nThe reason we need to pass the page to Beautiful Soup is that there is a ton of HTML code in the page we don\'t want. Our ultimate goal isn\'t to print out the complete page source. We don\'t want all the junky td and img and body tags. We want to free the data from the HTML by printing it out in a machine readable format we can repurpose for our own needs. In the next step we\'ll ask Beautiful Soup to step through the code and pull out only the good parts, but here in the first iteration we\'ll pause with just printing out the complete page code using a fun Beautiful Soup method called prettify(). It will spit out the HTML in a well-formed format. To take a look, save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\xa6\r\n<pre lang="Bash">\r\npython py-scrape-and-download.py\r\n</pre>\r\nAnd you should see something like....\r\n</pre>\r\n<pre lang="HTML">\r\n<html>\r\n <head>\r\n  <title>\r\n   According to Ben...\r\n  </title>\r\n </head>\r\n <body>\r\n  <h2>\r\n   The 10 Greatest Albums in the History of 2007\r\n  </h2>\r\n  <table padding="1" width="60%" border="1" style="text-align:center;">\r\n   <tr style="font-weight:bold">\r\n    <td>\r\n     Rank\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n     Artist\r\n    </td>\r\n...\r\n</pre>\r\n...which means that you\'ve successfully retrieved and printed out our first target. Now let\'s move on to scraping the data out from the HTML.\r\n<pre lang="Python">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nfrom mechanize import Browser\r\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\r\n\r\nmech = Browser()\r\n\r\nurl = "http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html"\r\npage = mech.open(url)\r\n\r\nhtml = page.read()\r\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html)\r\n\r\ntable = soup.find("table", border=1)\r\n\r\nfor row in table.findAll(\'tr\')[1:]:\r\n    col = row.findAll(\'td\')\r\n    \r\n    rank = col[0].string\r\n    artist = col[1].string\r\n    album = col[2].string\r\n    cover_link = col[3].img[\'src\']\r\n\r\n    record = (rank, artist, album, cover_link)\r\n    print "|".join(record)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe second version of our script, seen above, removes the prettify() command that concluded version one and replaces it with the Beautiful Soup code necessary to parse the rankings from the page. \r\n\r\nWhen you\'re scraping a real target out there on the wild Web, the mechanize part of the script is likely to remain pretty much the same, but the Beautiful Soup portion that pulls the data from the page is going to have change each time, tailored to work with however your target HTML is structured. \r\n\r\nSo your job as the scraper is to inspect your target table and figure out how you can get Beautiful Soup to hone in on the elements you want to harvest. I like to do this using the Firefox plugin <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug</a>, which allows you to right-click and, by choosing the "Inspect Element" option, have the browser pull up and highlight the HTML underlying any portion of the page. But all that\'s really necessary is that you take a look at the page\'s source code. \r\n\r\nSince most HTML pages you\'ll be targeting, including my sample site, will include more than one set of table tags, you often have to find something unique about the table you\'re after. This is necessary so that Beautiful Soup knows how to zoom in on that section of the code you\'re after and ignore all the flotsam around it. \r\n\r\nIf you look closely at this particular page, you\'ll note that while both table tags have the same width value, an easy way to distinguish them is that they have different border values...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="HTML">\r\n<table width="60%" border="1" style="text-align: center;" padding="1">\r\n...\r\n<table width="60%" border="0">\r\n</pre>\r\n...and the one we want to harvest has a border value of one. That\'s why the first Beautiful Soup command seen in the snippet above uses the find() method to capture the table with that characteristic.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">\r\ntable = soup.find("table", border=1)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nOnce that\'s been accomplished, the new table variable is immediately put to use in a loop that is designed to step through each row and pull out the data we want.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">\r\nfor row in table.findAll(\'tr\')[1:]:\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIt uses Beautiful Soup\'s findAll() method to put all of the tr tags (which is the HTML equivalent of a row) into a list. The [1:] modifier at the end instructs the loop to skip the first item, which, from looking at the page, we can tell is an unneeded header line. \r\n\r\nThen, after the loop is set up on the tr tags, we set up another list that will grab all of the td tags (the HTML equivalent of a column) from each row. \r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">    col = row.findAll(\'td\')</pre>\r\n\r\nNow pulling out the data is simply a matter of figuring out which order we can expect the data to appear in each row and pulling the corresponding values from the list. Since we expect rank, artist, album and cover to appear in each row from left to right, the first element of the col variable (col[0]) can always be expected to be the rank and the last element (col[3]) can always be expected to be the cover. So we create a new set of values to retrieve each, with some Beautiful Soup specific objects tacked on the end to grab only the bits we want.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">    rank = col[0].string\r\n    artist = col[1].string\r\n    album = col[2].string\r\n    cover_link = col[3].img[\'src\']</pre>\r\n\r\nThe ".string" object will return the text within the target tag (similar to javascript\'s innerHTML method). But in the case of something like the cover art, which is an image tag, not a string value, we can step down to the next tag nested within the td column -- img -- and access its source attribute by tacking on [\'src\']. This would work just the same for a hyperlink (.a[\'href\']) or any other attibute. And if you\'ve got multiple layers of nested tags, you can simply step down through them with a linked set of objects. For example, "b.a.string" would retrieve the string within a link within a bold tag. There\'s great documentation on these and other Beautiful Soup tricks <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/documentation.html">here</a>. \r\n\r\nAfter we\'ve wrangled out the data we want from the HTML, the only challenge remaining is to print it out. I accomplish that above by loading the column values into a list called record and printing it out use a trick that will print them with a pipe-delimiter using the .join method.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">\r\n    record = (rank, artist, album, cover_link)\r\n    print "|".join(record)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nPhew. That\'s a lot of explaining. I hope it made sense. I\'m happy to clarify or elaborate on any of it. But if you save the snippet above and run it. You should get a simple print out of the data that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n<pre lang="bash">10|LCD Soundsystem|Sound of Silver|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/sound%20of%20silver.jpg\r\n9|Ulrich Schnauss|Goodbye|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/goodbye.jpg\r\n8|The Clientele|God Save The Clientele|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/god%20save%20the%20clientele.jpg\r\n7|The Modernist|Collectors Series Pt. 1: Popular Songs|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/collectors%20series.jpg\r\n6|Bebel Gilberto|Momento|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/memento.jpg\r\n5|Various Artists|Jay Deelicious: 1995-1998|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/jaydeelicious.jpg\r\n4|Lindstrom and Prins Thomas|BBC Essential Mix|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/lindstrom%20prins%20thomas.jpg\r\n3|Go Home Productions|This Was Pop|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/this%20was%20pop.jpg\r\n2|Apparat|Walls|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/walls.jpg\r\n1|Caribou|Andorra|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/andorra.jpg</pre>\r\n\r\nSee the difference?! Pretty cool, right?\r\n\r\nBut, really, you could of done that with copy and paste. Or, if you\'re slick, maybe even <a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10877_11-6115870.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=tr">Excel\'s Web Query</a>.\r\n\r\nAs with our previous recipes, the real efficiencies aren\'t found until you can train your computer to repeat a task over a large body of data. One of the great things mechanize can do is step through pages one by one and help Beautiful Soup suck the data out of each. This is very helpful when you\'re trying to scrape the search results from online web queries, which are commonly displayed in paginated sets that run into hundreds and hundreds of pages. \r\n\r\nToday\'s example is only two pages in length, though the principles we learn here can later be applied to broader data sets. But before we can run, we have to learn how to walk. So, in that spirit, here\'s a simple expansion of our script above that will click on the "Next" link at the bottom of our example page and repeat the scrape on <a href="http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2006.html">my 2006 list</a>.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nfrom mechanize import Browser\r\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\r\n\r\ndef extract(soup, year):\r\n\r\n    table = soup.find("table", border=1)\r\n\r\n    for row in table.findAll(\'tr\')[1:]:\r\n        col = row.findAll(\'td\')\r\n    \r\n        rank = col[0].string\r\n        artist = col[1].string\r\n        album = col[2].string\r\n        cover_link = col[3].img[\'src\']\r\n\r\n        record = (str(year), rank, artist, album, cover_link)\r\n        print "|".join(record)\r\n\r\n\r\nmech = Browser()\r\n\r\nurl = "http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html"\r\n\r\npage1 = mech.open(url)\r\nhtml1 = page1.read()\r\nsoup1 = BeautifulSoup(html1)\r\nextract(soup1, 2007)\r\n\r\npage2 = mech.follow_link(text_regex="Next")\r\nhtml2 = page2.read()\r\nsoup2 = BeautifulSoup(html2)\r\nextract(soup2, 2006)</pre>\r\n\r\nNote that our Beautiful Soup snippet remains the same as above, but we\'ve moved it to the top of the script and placed it in a <a href="http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/functions/">Python function</a> called extract. Structured this way, the extract function is reusable on any number of pages as long as the HTML you\'re looking to parse is formatted the same way. \r\n\r\nThe function accepts two parameters, soup and year, which are passed in the lower part of our script after Beautiful Soup captures each page\'s contents. The first snippet ...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">page1 = mech.open(url)\r\nhtml1 = page1.read()\r\nsoup1 = BeautifulSoup(html1)\r\nextract(soup1, 2007)</pre>\r\n\r\n...essentially does the same thing as our early versions: visits the URL for my 2007 list and parses out the table. The only change is that the soup variable is now being passed to the extract function along with the year, so that it can be printed alongside the data columns in our output by adding it to the "record" list inside the function here:\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">        record = (str(year), rank, artist, album, cover_link)</pre>\r\n\r\nI figured it\'s a nice add since then our eventual results will contain a field that discerns the 2007 list from the 2006 list. \r\n\r\nNow check out easy it is to get mechanize to step through to the next page.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">page2 = mech.follow_link(text_regex="Next")\r\nhtml2 = page2.read()\r\nsoup2 = BeautifulSoup(html2)\r\nextract(soup2, 2006)</pre>\r\n\r\nAll it takes is feeding the link\'s string value to mechanize\'s follow_link() method and, boom, you\'re walking over to the next page. Treat what you get back the same as we did our first "page" and, bam, you\'ve done it. Save the script, run it, and you should see something more like this:\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">2007|10|LCD Soundsystem|Sound of Silver|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/sound%20of%20silver.jpg\r\n2007|9|Ulrich Schnauss|Goodbye|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/goodbye.jpg\r\n2007|8|The Clientele|God Save The Clientele|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/god%20save%20the%20clientele.jpg\r\n2007|7|The Modernist|Collectors Series Pt. 1: Popular Songs|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/collectors%20series.jpg\r\n2007|6|Bebel Gilberto|Momento|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/memento.jpg\r\n2007|5|Various Artists|Jay Deelicious: 1995-1998|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/jaydeelicious.jpg\r\n2007|4|Lindstrom and Prins Thomas|BBC Essential Mix|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/lindstrom%20prins%20thomas.jpg\r\n2007|3|Go Home Productions|This Was Pop|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/this%20was%20pop.jpg\r\n2007|2|Apparat|Walls|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/walls.jpg\r\n2007|1|Caribou|Andorra|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/andorra.jpg\r\n2006|10|Lily Allen|Alright, Still|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/alright%20still.jpg\r\n2006|9|Nouvelle Vague|Nouvelle Vague|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/nouvelle%20vague.jpg\r\n2006|8|Bookashade|Movements|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/movements.jpg\r\n2006|7|Charlotte Gainsbourg|5:55|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/555.jpg\r\n2006|6|The Drive-By Truckers|The Blessing and the Curse|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/blessing%20and%20curse.jpg\r\n2006|5|Basement Jaxx|Crazy Itch Radio|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/crazy%20itch%20radio.jpg\r\n2006|4|Love is All|Nine Times The Same Song|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/nine%20times.jpg\r\n2006|3|Ewan Pearson|Sci.Fi.Hi.Fi_01|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/sci%20fi%20hi%20fi.jpg\r\n2006|2|Neko Case|Fox Confessor Brings The Flood|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/fox%20confessor.jpg\r\n2006|1|Ellen Allien & Apparat|Orchestra of Bubbles|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/orchestra%20of%20bubbles.jpg</pre>\r\n\r\nNow all that\'s left on our checklist is to figure out a way to download the cover art in addition to recording the urls. When we\'re interested in just snatching a simple file off the web, I like to use the urlretrieve() function found in Python\'s urlib module. All you have to do is add it to your import line, as below, and tell it where to save the files. I just stuff it in the extract loop so it pulls down the file immediately after scraping its row in the table. Check it out.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nfrom mechanize import Browser\r\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\r\nimport urllib, os\r\n\r\ndef extract(soup, year):\r\n\r\n    table = soup.find("table", border=1)\r\n\r\n    for row in table.findAll(\'tr\')[1:]:\r\n        col = row.findAll(\'td\')\r\n    \r\n        rank = col[0].string\r\n        artist = col[1].string\r\n        album = col[2].string\r\n        cover_link = col[3].img[\'src\']\r\n\r\n        record = (str(year), rank, artist, album, cover_link)\r\n        print >> outfile, "|".join(record)\r\n\r\n        save_as = os.path.join("./", album + ".jpg")\r\n        urllib.urlretrieve(cover_link, save_as)\r\n        print "Downloaded %s album cover" % album\r\n       \r\n\r\noutfile = open("albums.txt", "w")\r\n\r\nmech = Browser()\r\n\r\nurl = "http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html"\r\n\r\npage1 = mech.open(url)\r\nhtml1 = page1.read()\r\nsoup1 = BeautifulSoup(html1)\r\nextract(soup1, 2007)\r\n\r\npage2 = mech.follow_link(text_regex="Next")\r\nhtml2 = page2.read()\r\nsoup2 = BeautifulSoup(html2)\r\nextract(soup2, 2006)\r\n\r\noutfile.close()</pre>\r\n\r\nWhile I was at it, I also added in an outfile where the scrape results are saved in a text file, just like we did in our previous recipes. Run this version and then check out your working directory, where you should see all the images as well as the new outfile. \r\n\r\nVoila. I think we\'re done. If this is useful for people, next time we can cover how you leverage these basic tools against search forms and larger result sets. Per usual, if you spot a screw up, or I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not being clear, just shoot me an email or drop a comment and we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll sort it out. Hope this is helpful to somebody.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a postscript, since we\'re kind of on a roll here, I thought it might be fun to cook up an LAT version of the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pythoncook/">Python Cookbook</a> cover, in the classic O\'Reilly style.

(hat tip: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2008/04/expelled_a_box_office_success.php">Chris Mooney</a>)\r\n\r\n[poll id="4"]\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong> The peanut gallery over at Mooney\'s blog posed the question about whether the geographic distribution of Expelled showings might offer something of interest.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t have the time to do anything too sophisticated (no geocoding to lat/long or ZIP code level analysis), but I did have time to pull the latest listings from <a href="http://www.expelledthemovie.com/theaterap.php">Expelled\'s theater locator</a> and run the following charts over at <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/app">Many Eyes</a>. (FWIW, I only found 1050 theaters in the Expelled search, but Box Office Mojo says it showed on 1052).\r\n\r\nThis first one is a map that totals up the number of showings by state.\r\n\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/api/v1/snapshot/89ade5ae1961a32201196fb17aed08f1.js"></script>\r\n\r\nAnd then a scatterplot that rates the number of showings in each state against its population.

What I immediately look for are any states well above or below the pack. It looks like New York has a pretty low number of showings per capita, as do a number of other "blue" states, but so does Pennsylvania, home to the recent <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.msnbc.msn.com%2Fid%2F10545387%2F&ei=HT0MSOjnC5y-iAGRq4j9Ag&usg=AFQjCNFdZdwYAyKiDzE1FPPgaXK_NAA7KA&sig2=IX_r_0A4_eOo6e_tzpkIaQ">Dover controversy</a> over Intelligent Design.

p432
aS'Today we sprung what might be the LAT\'s first ever data app plugged directly into the front page. Some new foreclosure numbers came and we were able to quickly turn around the data so users could pop in their zipcode, or drill down and browse around the vast five county area we call "SoCal."\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/caspio-foreclosure.jpg" alt="yep." width="100%" />\r\n\r\nAnyway, with a little free time this evening, I ferried the data over to Many Eyes and cooked up a couple data visualizations. They\'re too much fun to keep to myself.\r\n\r\nFirst, a visual version of the zipcode search, via ME\'s "block histogram." Try popping in "LA" or "Santa Monica" or 90210. The data isn\'t adjusted to account for variations in population, but you can see what a cool spin on the classic search-and-return mechanism this gives you. Not only can you easily learn more about a particular locality, you can -- at the same time -- see where it falls on the distribution curve.\r\n\r\n<script src="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/api/v1/snapshot/89ade5ae197b317601197f0a06ac0512.js" type="text/javascript"></script>\r\n\r\nThe second is a bit fancier. It\'s a three-dimensional scatterplot charting foreclosure frequency on the Y axis against median household income on the X axis, with the size of the zipcode dots determined by the number of foreclosures per 1000 households (the Z-axis), a number that gives you a nice angle for comparison. Try flipping the Y and Z around, for a fun twist. It gives a quick way to explore the richest and poorest areas hit by the foreclosure boom, and it\'s a hell of a lot of fun to mouse around with.\r\n\r\n<script type="text/javascript" src="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/api/v1/snapshot/89ade5ae197b317601197e1a2f2f043c.js"></script>\r\n\r\nOr at least I think so.

aS'Python Recipe: Connect to a MySQL database, execute a query, print the results.'
p447
aS'Today let\'s take a look at how you can use Python to connect to your MySQL database, issue a SQL query and do things with the results.\r\n\r\nIt\'s not that hard to write a simple SQL command by hand and muck with the results, so why bother? Like earlier recipes, our reward will be saving time and energy by automating a task that would normally require manual labor. It becomes clear when you bump into something you need to do 500 times, or make part of your daily routine.\r\n\r\nFor example, one thing I try to do at work is keep documentation related to all of my datasets. I keep a series of wiki pages devoted to each database that lists its data sources, explains its origins, catalogs helpful SQL snippets and defines the fields in each table.\r\n\r\nThe wiki application I use -- <a href="http://twiki.org/">TWiki</a> -- accepts HTML code and the convention I\'ve settled on is to format each table\'s field definitions in a standard set of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp">table tags</a>. So every time I add a new MySQL table and want to document it, I need to build another HTML table for the wiki. That\'s a pain to do by hand, especially when the table has a lot of fields. To save Ben the trouble, let\'s write a simple Python script that will...\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Log into the MySQL database</li>\r\n\t<li>Acquire the list of columns from a MySQL table</li>\r\n\t<li>Print the columns out in an HTML table</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIt\'s not very exciting, but it\'ll introduce you to the basics. And once you start walking you\'ll quickly be able to run.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Install the MySQLdb module.</strong>\r\n\r\nBefore you can tap into your MySQL db with Python, you need to install the "MySQL for Python" module (a.k.a. MySQLdb). The file is found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/">here</a>, and, while I haven\'t tested it, it looks like there\'s a .exe installer for you Windows kids. There\'s also a nice stab and cataloging different methods <a href="http://docs.turbogears.org/1.0/DatabaseMySQL">here</a>. If, like me, you\'re running Ubuntu Linux, installation is as simple as opening GNOME\'s package manager and selecting the "python-mysqldb" package, or running an "apt-get" from your terminal.\r\n\r\nYou can test whether its been properly installed by opening up your python shell and trying to import the module. So fire up the shell...\r\n<pre lang="Bash">python</pre>\r\n...and pop it off...\r\n<pre lang="Python">Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Mar  7 2008, 04:10:12)\r\n[GCC 4.1.3 20070929 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.2-16ubuntu2)] on linux2\r\nType "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.\r\n>>> import MySQLdb\r\n>>> </pre>\r\nIf the interpreter accepts the commands and kicks down the next line without an error, you know you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re okay.

And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs Ubuntu Linux. I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2t work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment.

So you might \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93mkdir\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d a new working directory in your \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93C:/TEMP\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc2\x9d folder or wherever else you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2d like to work.

Do that by hitting:\r\n<pre lang="Bash">i</pre>\r\n<strong>4. Write the code!</strong>\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="1">#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nimport sys, MySQLdb\r\n\r\ndef PrintFields(database, table):\r\n    """ Connects to the table specified by the user and prints out its fields in HTML format used by Ben\'s wiki. """\r\n\r\n    host = \'localhost\'\r\n    user = \'user\'\r\n    password = \'password\'\r\n    conn = MySQLdb.Connection(db=database, host=host, user=user, passwd=password)\r\n    mysql = conn.cursor()\r\n\r\n    sql = """ SHOW COLUMNS FROM %s """ % table\r\n    mysql.execute(sql)\r\n\r\n    fields=mysql.fetchall()\r\n\r\n    print \'<table border="0"><tr><th>order</th><th>name</th><th>type</th><th>description</th></tr>\'\r\n    print \'<tbody>\'\r\n\r\n    counter = 0\r\n    for field in fields:\r\n        counter = counter + 1\r\n        name = field[0]\r\n        type = field[1]\r\n        print \'<tr><td>\' + str(counter) + \'</td><td>\' + name + \'</td><td>\' + type + \'</td><td></td></tr>\'\r\n\r\n    print \'</tbody>\'\r\n    print \'</table>\'\r\n\r\n    mysql.close()\r\n    conn.close()\r\n\r\nusers_database = sys.argv[1]\r\nusers_table = sys.argv[2]\r\nprint "Wikified HTML for " + users_database + "." + users_table\r\nprint "========================"\r\nPrintFields(users_database, users_table)</pre>Obviously, the first thing you need to do is import the modules we need. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-sys.html">"sys" module</a> will allow us to accept inputs from the command line later, and our new friend, MySQLdb, will help us connect to the database. \r\n\r\nThen you can see that the bulk of the script is taken up by a function, named PrintFields, that extends from line four to line 32. That contains all of the card tricks we\'ll need to connect to our local db, run a query and print it out however we want. In this case, we\'re spitting out the data in an HTML shell I\'ve concocted to create a complete table when it\'s all done. \r\n\r\nAfter the loop closes at line 32, the remainder of the script uses sys to grab the first two arguments passed in by the user and hand them over to the function. So this way, by providing the database and table names at the time of execution, I can ask the script to print out the fields from any table I\'ve got. For instance, we can print out the generic time_zone table that comes MySQL\'s "mysql" settings database like so...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">python py-connect-to-mysql.py mysql time_zone</pre>\r\n\r\nAnd you should get something like ...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">Wikified HTML for mysql.time_zone\r\n========================\r\n<table border="0"><tr><th>order</th><th>name</th><th>type</th><th>description</th></tr>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Time_zone_id</td><td>int(10) unsigned</td><td></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Use_leap_seconds</td><td>enum(\'Y\',\'N\')</td><td></td></tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table></pre>\r\n\r\nThen what I\'d normally do is just copy and paste that into my wiki. The script doesn\'t have any error handling or fancy tricks, which I think makes it a good starter example on the basics. Let\'s pull out the things you\'ll need to know. So let\'s walk through a few of them.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="7">\r\n    host = \'localhost\'\r\n    user = \'user\'\r\n    password = \'password\'\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThis first snippet contains all the local information about your MySQL that will need to be customized to fit your rig. You\'ll need to change the definitions for user and password to whatever it is you use. And if the database you want to tap isn\'t on your localhost, but perhaps networked elsewhere, you\'ll need to change the host definition to its IP address or alias.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="10">\r\n    conn = MySQLdb.Connection(db=database, host=host, user=user, passwd=password)\r\n    mysql = conn.cursor()\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThen this next step will pass all of your local specifics to MySQLdb and open up a "cursor." You can use that to interact with the database in the same way you normally would with Microsoft Access or another piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI software</a>. A lot of people might name the variable containing the cursor as "cursor," but it really doesn\'t matter. As seen above, I like to name it mysql. It\'s just personal preference. Notice that we didn\'t define the database variable in the earlier snippet. That\'s because it\'s being passed into the function by the user. We know that because it\'s up there at the top of our function...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="4">def PrintFields(database, table):</pre>\r\n\r\n...and fed in at the bottom after we capture the user input with sys...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="34">users_database = sys.argv[1]</pre>\r\n...and then passed in with our function call...\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="38">PrintFields(users_database, users_table)</pre>\r\n\r\nBut what the hell is in that argv variable, anyway? Let\'s find out. I\'m going to edit our script to include the following line...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">print sys.argv</pre>\r\n\r\n...run the script again...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">python py-connect-to-mysql.py mysql time_zone</pre>\r\n\r\n...and here\'s what we get...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">\r\n[\'py-connect-to-mysql.py\', \'mysql\', \'time_zone\']</pre>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nPretty self-explanatory, right? Now back to our function.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="13">\r\n    sql = " SHOW COLUMNS FROM %s " % table\r\n    mysql.execute(sql)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWith our connection set, the next thing to do is to use MySQL to run a query. I do it by storing a SQL command in a variable and then passing it to to MySQLdb execute function. You\'ll note that I use Python\'s magic "%s" command to write in the contents of the table variable, which, like the database variable, has been passed into the function by the user. By doing that, we\'re now able to run that same SHOW COLUMNS command on whatever database and table combination we pass in. Provided the table actually exists. \r\n\r\nIt\'s simple tricks like that which will enable you to really start flying with automation. What if your job required you to kick out data reports for each or any of the 50 states on command, or if you wanted to automate a web scrape to deposit its findings in your database every time it runs, or maybe even make an RSS feed that updates every 15 minutes. A simple concept like this, which allows for some of the SQL specifics to be specified programmatically, could save you a ton of time.\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python" line="16">   fields=mysql.fetchall()</pre>\r\n\r\nThis next line will store the results of the query in a variable called fields, which we\'ll print out using one of the simple loops I covered in <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/">previous recipes</a>, pulling out the first and second fields (name and datatype) for my table. You could take a look what\'s in the list by printing it out to your terminal before running the loop. Let\'s try that by adding...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">print fields</pre>\r\n\r\n...to our script. Run it again from the top and now you\'ll get the ...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">((\'Time_zone_id\', \'int(10) unsigned\', \'NO\', \'PRI\', None, \'auto_increment\'), (\'Use_leap_seconds\', "enum(\'Y\',\'N\')", \'NO\', \'\', \'N\', \'\'))</pre>\r\n\r\nSince I don\'t want all of the settings for my docs, just the name and field type, as we loop through each row I only pull out the first two items (field[0], field[1]). All the rest of the mess around there is designed to print out the data in my custom HTML shell, which really shouldn\'t matter for your purposes, so why bother here. So, what the hell, I think we\'re done. Per usual, if you spot a screw up, or I\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2m not being clear, just shoot me an email or drop a comment and we\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll sort it out. Hope this is helpful to somebody.'

aS'Ubuntu Recipe: How to automagically post your Last.fm feed to Twitter.'
p452
aS'I signed up for Twitter this morning, opening an account at <a href="http://twitter.com/palewire">http://twitter.com/palewire</a>. Since I haven\'t seen or heard from my cell phone in a week or two, don\'t count on much on the scene reporting. But I did take a few minutes this morning to line up <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/palewire">my Last.fm feed</a>, so that my lastest listenings are now automatically Twittered to the huddled masses yearning to have my musical taste shoved down their throat.\r\n\r\nFor any other Ubuntu users who\'d like to follow along, here\'s a quick recap on how I made it happen.\r\n\r\n1. Move to the folder where you store random scripts. Me, I use...\r\n<pre lang="bash">cd /usr/local/bin</pre>\r\n\r\n2. Create a new Perl script and open it in gedit.\r\n<pre lang="bash">sudo gedit twitter_fm.pl</pre>\r\n\r\n3. Copy and paste in the <a href="http://walterhiggins.net/lastfm_to_twitter.html">ready-to-serve code</a> provided by Walter Higgins.\r\n\r\n4. Edit in your Twitter and Last.fm login information. Save and exit the file.\r\n\r\n5. Create a new shell script.\r\n<pre lang="bash">sudo gedit twitter_fm.sh</pre>\r\n\r\n6. Paste in the following, editing the folder structure to reflect wherever you stuck your steez.\r\n<pre lang="shell">#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\nperl /usr/local/bin/twitter_fm.pl</pre>\r\n\r\n7. Set the shell script so it becomes executable.\r\n<pre lang="bash">sudo chmod +x twitter_fm.sh</pre>\r\n\r\n8. Navigate through the System>Preferences>Session menu as described <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/how-to-add-a-program-to-the-ubuntu-startup-list-after-login/">here</a> and add the shell script to your startup processes.\r\n\r\n9. Restart!\r\n\r\nI just patched this mess together a couple minutes ago, so there might be some bugs. Either in my setup or in Walter\'s script. Don\'t know yet. Let me know if you see anything idiotic on my part. \r\n\r\nI also installed Wordpress\'s <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools</a> plugin, so now my latest blog posts will also be sent out via Twitter.\r\n\r\nAlso on the Twitter tip, earlier this week we launched a feed at work for our popular political blog, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/">Top of the Ticket</a>. It includes the latest posts from our team of writers, and, on election nights, live election results as they come in. You can sign up <a href="http://twitter.com/latimestot">here</a>. For anyone looking to reroute their own data streams to Twitter, I can\'t recommend Chris Thompon\'s <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~cthom/Net-Twitter-1.06/lib/Net/Twitter.pm">Net::Twitter</a>  Perl module enough. Easy. Peasy.'

p477
aS'Today our A1 features <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-redlight19-2008may19,0,5321069.story">Rich Connell\'s look</a> at the effectiveness of all those automated red light cameras positioned around Los Angeles. Here\'s the nut:\r\n<blockquote>In Los Angeles, officials estimate that 80% of red light camera tickets go not to those running through intersections but to drivers making rolling right turns, a Times review has found.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful selling points for photo enforcement systems, which now monitor 175 intersections in Los Angeles County and hundreds more across the United States, has been the promise of reducing collisions caused by drivers barreling through red lights.\r\n\r\nBut it is the right-turn infraction -- a frequently misunderstood and less pressing safety concern -- that drives tickets and revenue in the nation\'s second-biggest city and at least half a dozen others across the county.</blockquote>\r\nOur web package includes some <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-redlight-vid,0,1506317.worldnowvideo">hot tape</a> put together by Rich, an awesome <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-redlight12-2008may12-f,0,2138553.flash">interactive explainer</a> by Raoul Ranoa, the now perfunctory <a href="http://www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=117631292961056724014.00044d231a97bc45a81a3&amp;ll=34.232242,-118.218384&amp;spn=0.967344,1.702881&amp;t=p&amp;z=9">Google Map</a>, and my own little goofy idea: portable downloads for TomTom and Garmin GPS devices (check out the roadblock halfway down <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-redlight19-2008may19,0,5321069.story">the main story</a>).\r\n\r\nLoading the points into your device will not only map them on your dashboard monitor -- but you can also easily program your system to give you an audio warning as you approach upcoming lights. And in that same soothing computer voice that already tells you when to turn.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure how interested readers will be in this sort of product, but it seemed like a fun experiment. And since Rich had put in a great effort collecting the data from LA\'s many fragmented municipalities, it seemed like we had to look for some extra yard to go for.\r\n\r\nThe technical part is pretty easy. Both manufacturers have handy developer guides that -- once the data is prepared -- only take a couple hours to suss out. Here\'s <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/addto/">TomTom</a>. Here\'s <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/products/poiloader/">Garmin</a>.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on other newspapery data projects that might work for GPS? The most dangerous intersections?

aS"California's War Dead."
p487
aS'This Memorial Day weekend marked the formal launch of <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/">California\'s War Dead</a>, our database of the state\'s casualties from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It\'s the result of a lot of hard work by many people at the paper, a large share of which had already been carried through the years by our many obituary writers.\r\n\r\nThe site intends to allow users to explore the data using a variety of criteria (for example, you can quickly look up fallen troops by <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/hometown">hometown</a>, <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/high-school/">high school</a> or <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/marital-status/">marital status</a>). And to learn more about individuals by reading their obituaries from our back archives. Choice quotes have been selected to "pop" out of the individual profile pages and visitors are encouraged to leave memories and thoughts as comments.\r\n\r\nBesides all my coworkers who pitched in to make this happen on a tight deadline, thank yous should be extended to all the great developers in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.djangoproject.com%2F&amp;ei=YCo7SN7vJpGqsAOzmvW2DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfxYhHSLrgk6aVrm5Bbc2ozc89rA&amp;sig2=Qb22Q47-imtI1Y6zxu-gFA">the Django community</a>. They not only provided the Web programming tools that made this idea possible, but also the <a href="http://holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307/">leadership</a> that showed me how the tools can be used to make journalism <em>for</em> the Web, not just <em>on</em> the Web. The same goes for all the people in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicar.org%2F&amp;ei=ZSs7SKncIZmIsAPhnv27DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFv1OMXDU_2U5mOn6I-DfJcHnfT7Q&amp;sig2=It6TrOcpwh1486leIvWaAw">the NICAR community</a> who, by leading by example, have pushed me to keep learning new things and have the courage to take chances outside of journalism\'s well worn comfort zones. Personally, I just hope that first group can forgive me for ripping off their ideas and that the second group doesn\'t resent my getting the opportunity to do things like this without having to put in the once requisite 5 to 10 years on the cops-and-courts beat.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re stretched for time, or maybe doubting there\'s anything new to be learned about the war, let me promote a couple spots that might interest you.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Over the course of assembling the data, I was surprised to learn how many immigrants to California have died. It\'s more than fifty, from Mexico and the Phillipines and South Korea and a number of other places. Check out the lists <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/country-of-birth/mexico/">here</a>. A fascinating story is of Sgt. Rafael Peralta of San Diego, who enlisted the same day he received his Green Card and died in Fallouja, Iraq, when he sacrificed himself to save his compatriots from a grenade attack. His profile is <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/rafael-peralta/">here</a> and the story of his heroic death is <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/06/local/me-marine6">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The most rewarding part of the project for me has been to see how quickly we\'re getting great, thoughtful comments submitted by friends and family members of the deceased. One of my goals in the design was to give their writing equal footing with our previous reporting. It can be heartbreaking to read, but I\'m proud to have helped make something that people think is worthy of such sensitive information. Examples I find particularly moving are the memories shared by the family of <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/jason-j-buzzard/">Sgt. Jason J. Buzzard</a> of Ukiah and <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/christopher-d-leon/">Corporal Christopher D. Leon</a> of Lancaster, who I\'m honored to know better now than I did before our commentors contributed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It seems natural to expect that spending so much time with casualty data would have a numbing effect. But I think that\'s only the case when we let the very real people we\'ve lost remain numbers in a casualty count or unknown names on a page. It\'s the stories that bring them to life, and my experience has been that the more stories you hear, the less numb you feel. The pain is in the details. A moving example is <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/02/16/local/me-daily16">Teresa Watanabe\'s obituary</a> of <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/mark-j-daily/">Lt. Mark J. Daily</a> of Irvine, who was inspired to join the war by the political writing of war advocate Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens has since gone to write a moving response to learning of Daily\'s readership, and sacrifice, that you can find <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/11/hitchens200711">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Finally, I\'d suggest checking out <a href="http://www.latimes.com/video/?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=2521929">the video of California\'s Riverside Cemetery</a> by the LAT\'s Saatchi Cunningham. Riverside is home to dozens of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the top resting place in the state.</li>\r\n</ul>'

p492
aS'This afternoon I experimented with my first effort at photo stitching, using a program called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhugin.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;ei=a_pBSIbHJJG6sAPAo4GeBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHu63cvIP_n93LCLVyHLN2EyC_7bg&amp;sig2=cY9-LhUZi8goejtFWwXtJQ">Hugin</a> to piece together the view from my window. Click for greater detail.\r\n\r\n<div style="align: center;"><a title="The view from my window by palewire, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77114776@N00/2540319386/sizes/l/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2361/2540319386_420d1d39a9_b.jpg" alt="The view from my window" width="512" height="165" /></a></div>\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it\'s hardly a perfect job. But I think it fits together well enough. The most obvious flaw seems to be the shift in color that splits St. Vibiania\'s in half. I\'m a long way from a photo expert, but I suspect that\'s caused by the automatic adjustments my camera makes as it saves images in jpg format. There\'s probably some easy way to avoid that (shooting all of the photographs in a manually selected adjustment scheme, or RAW format), but I\'ll leave figuring that out for another day. But if you are an expert, or if I\'m totally off base, please feel free to chide away. I\'m eager to learn.'

aS'Terminal Recipe: How to download an entire Web site with wget.'
p507
aS'From time to time, an occasion might arise when you\'d like to download an entire Web site. At my old job, I liked to pull down government sites and go on fishing expeditions with Google Desktop Search for hot terms (ex. names of corporations and political appointees) or certain file types (ex. Excel, Access, CSV, et cetera). And the other day at my current job <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-me-kozinski12-2008jun12,0,778115.story">a situation</a> cropped up where the newsroom wanted to download a bunch of files quickly, so it was handy to set a spider loose rather than sit there and try to download everything click by click.\r\n\r\nOne way to handle the job is to use a command-line utility called <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> to crawl your target and mirror its files on your local computer.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re working on a Macbook, the first thing you\'ll need to do is install wget. I\'d suggest you do that by downloading the latest version and compiling the binary from the source code. That might sound scary, but it\'s just a fancy way of saying you\'re going to install something from the command line instead of clicking a bunch of pretty boxes. Some other sites are going to push you toward pretty boxes and maybe even this big bloated thing called Fink, but, trust me on this one, it\'s going to be a lot easier for you down the road if you learn how to install stuff yourself. And this is a simple enough example that it\'s worth the shot.\r\n\r\nSo, if you\'re with me, before you do anything else, download and install <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Mac\'s XCode</a>, which includes the compilers you\'ll need to build stuff on your own.\r\n\r\nThen just open your terminal and let rip with the following...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">mkdir src\r\ncd src\r\ncurl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-latest.tar.gz\r\ntar xvfz wget-latest.tar.gz\r\ncd wget-1.11.3\r\n./configure\r\nsudo make install</pre>\r\n\r\nYou\'ve just compiled your first program. We just made a new directory for storing source code, downloaded wget\'s source, unzipped it, and then "made" the file with our XCode compiler. Pretty easy, right? The only catch is that you\'ll need your computer\'s administrator password to run the "sudo" command that will create wget\'s binary in your system folder.\r\n\r\nIn the future, that configure/make part is going to be the same for most of the source code you run into. When you encounter a new batch, just check the INSTALL or README docs where they\'ll usually let you know if there\'s anything else fancy you need to do.\r\n\r\nNow test it out by hammering in the following...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">wget</pre>\r\n\r\nAnd there\'s your new utility, waiting to run things down on your behalf. Check out how it easy it is. Want to mirror a Web site? Here\'s all you need to type...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Bash">wget -mk http://www.foo.com</pre>\r\n\r\nBlammo, you\'re off to the races, walking your target\'s directory structure and saving all the files to your hard drive. The -m option puts wget in mirror mode and the -k option will convert all the hyperlinks so they\'re suitable for local viewing. Then you just feed it the URL you\'re after.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re a Linux or Windows user, the command should be the same.  If you\'re a Windows user, you can try it with a release like <a href="http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/">this one</a>. And if you run Linux, like I do, wget should already be installed and ready to roll in most distributions. No bothering with XCode or new downloads or any of that nonsense.'

p512
aS'Yesterday I launched <a href="http://www.tickertube.org">Tickertube.org</a>, my first attempt at hosting a site using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud">Amazon\'s EC2 service</a>. It\'s a simple app, just an ever refreshing list of links from sites that write about telecommunications policy. I used to cover this stuff in DC, and I don\'t really like using RSS readers, so it\'s useful for me, if not anyone else.\r\n\r\nBut my objective isn\'t to build a hit site. I just want to figure out Amazon\'s toys. What I learned is that while they aren\'t all that well documented, they can be a lot of fun once you figure out the basics. You\'ll have to do more hands-on server configuration than you would with <a href="www.feedjack.org/">Google App Engine</a>, but greater control does come with benefits.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to use Tickertube to woodshop a little in developing for smart phones. But since I don\'t have an iPhone or Blackberry, I don\'t have any way to test it out. Or a lot of motivation to get it done. But if somebody out there would like to use the site with a mobile device (and wouldn\'t that be a shock!), just let me know and I\'ll try to put in the extra time to adapt the HTML. Same goes if there are any feeds you\'d like me to add the pool. Just shout.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the great tools that made this project easy. Besides Amazon, much love to <a href="www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> and <a href="www.feedjack.org/">Feedjack</a>.'

aS'Today marked the release of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-charity6-2008jul06,0,6668563.story">a new <em>Times</em> investigation</a> into the poor performance of for-profit fundraisers hired by not-for-profit charities. The poster child is Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW), an advocacy group that <a href="http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_Mission_History">rails against reckless government spending</a>. According to reporting and analysis by Charles Piller and Doug Smith:\r\n<blockquote>Records filed with the California attorney general\'s office show that over the last decade, for-profit fundraisers for [CAGW] kept more than 94 cents of every donated dollar.</blockquote>\r\nAnd the bigger picture:\r\n<blockquote>In more than 5,800 campaigns on behalf of charities that were registered with the state attorney general from 1997 to 2006, the fundraisers reported taking in $2.6 billion. They kept nearly $1.4 billion -- about 54 cents of every dollar raised.</blockquote>\r\nAs part of our effort to package the story for the Web, I worked with <em>Times</em> staff to publish all of the records collected for analysis as an online database. What we came up with allows readers to look up the track record of individual charities, browse charities of similar types, and quickly seek out the most and least efficient charities using a goofball visualization I cooked up with our graphics guy, <a href="http://www.studioburbank.com/">Thomas Lauder</a>. You can check it out <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-home,0,7128706.htmlstory">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe app was pulled together using <a href="http://www.caspio.com/">Caspio</a>, a browser-based program for building data-driven web applications. While it is technically true, as the site claims, that developing a working Caspio app requires "no more programming," my experience has been that you\'re going to have to invest a significant amount of time hacking at its kludgey GUI to come up with something half-way decent. Whether you want to invest your time doing that, or mastering a more robust development option, is entirely up to you.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.tubotu.com/?p=43">Other</a>, <a href="http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2008/06/29/caspios-lessons/">smarter</a> <a href="http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2007/12/07/trial-by-caspio/">people</a> have invested a goodly amount of space to explaining Caspio\'s deficiencies, so I\'ll leave that to <a href="http://commonsensej.blogspot.com/2007/10/caspio-dustup.html">the</a> <a href="http://www.jacobian.org/writing/2007/sep/12/db-journalism/">links</a>. Instead let\'s break out below a couple tricks that helped me at least marginally improve today\'s product, in hopes they might be useful to somebody. (Though I suppose any "improvement" is a matter of opinion! Let me know what I fucked up.)\r\n\r\n<strong>Hack 01: Roll your own forms</strong>\r\n\r\nCaspio offers several templates. The one I use most often is the "search-and-result" set. It accepts a user\'s input and returns any matching values. Might sound complicated, but it\'s the same thing as Google. You pop something in, and you get back any hits. You can examine specimens in the wild <a href="http://dunes.cincinnati.com/data/crime/fbi/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.tbo.com/news/reports/foreclosures/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/datacenter/babynames.html">here</a>. (Thorough readers will notice that, at least at the time of writing, the Cincinnati app is dead on arrival, bearing only the cryptic message "<a href="http://www.palewire.com/images/dead-caspio-cropped.png">DataPage does not exist. (Caspio Bridge error) (50501)</a>.")\r\n\r\nSince the "search" and "result" sides of the app are glued together in a single panel, the search box can\'t be very easily plugged in around your site. You\'ll have to find a way to make Caspio\'s gunky JavaScript code work in each and every location where you want to encourage user input. The result is that most Caspio apps -- including all three linked above -- tend to live in backwater, standalone pages, lampooned by Matt Waite as "<a href="http://www.mattwaite.com/2008/01/02/data-ghettos/">data ghettos</a>." (Personally, I prefer "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ4EVnAxHIc">Ghettos of the Mind</a>.")\r\n\r\nThat might be acceptable if you\'re looking to make a destination page for your corporate intranet, like an employee directory. But it\'s just not good enough for news Web sites, which draw a huge share of their incoming traffic on the homepage and the first page of featured stories. If your database isn\'t prominently displayed there -- and it isn\'t unless you\'ve got a search box or other entry point gaping open on the page -- you\'ve losing a whole lot of potential traffic. I think there\'s something to be said for a "data central" section, but you\'re probably giving up a lot of clicks if you\'re waiting for people to hit the vague looking "data" link in your left-nav bar.\r\n\r\nSo what\'s the hack? It\'s pretty simple. Just build a search-and-result box without a search, which you then provide with your own custom HTML. You can then reuse the search box anywhere you want: the frontpage, right-rail, story-level reefer or -- heaven forfend -- standalone "data ghetto."\r\n\r\nHere\'s how you do it, shot by shot.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step1.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFirst turn on the advanced options and allow parameters.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step2.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nTell Caspio it should look for an external parameter in the URL, rather than use it\'s native search form.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step3.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nTell it which field it should run the inputs against. In this case, we\'re building a search on a data table\'s "name" field.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step4a.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nNow instruct Caspio to look for the user input after a query string variable called "name," and to evaluate it against the data table using "contains" style matching, as opposed to "exact" or "starts with" matching. If you were using a unique identifer like a primary key for the lookup (as you likely would if you were building a dropdown menu rather than a search box), you would probably want to use an "exact" match instead of "contains."\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step4b.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nThen finish up by telling Caspio how to handle what to do with blank variables or circumstances where you don\'t have a match.\r\n\r\nNow you should deploy the Caspio app as you normally would, and then craft an HTML form on a different page that points to its location, placing the user\'s input in the query string. For example, the search box in our charity app looks like this, with all the styling removed:\r\n<pre lang="HTML"><form action="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-name,0,5949050.htmlstory" method="get">\r\n<input maxlength="100" name="name" size="6" type="text" />\r\n<input type="submit" value="Go" />\r\n</form>\r\n</pre>\r\nThat\'ll send people to the following link, where they\'ll see the search results as they\'re formatted by the Caspio GUI.\r\n<pre lang="HTML">http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-name,0,5949050.htmlstory?name=Red Cross</pre>\r\n<strong>Hack 02: Permalinks for easy deep linking</strong>\r\n\r\nAn added benefit of using Hack 01 is that your results pages can have permalinks, albeit long and ugly ones. The link above will always call up the results for a search of "Red Cross," and if you build all your drilldown pages this way, using a primary key as the external parameter, they\'ll each have a distinct URL. That came in handy with the charity story because it allowed me to deep link charity names and types from <a href="http://http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-charity6-2008jul06,0,6668563.story">the story</a> down into the database (ex. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-detail,0,922401.htmlstory?CharityCode=713">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-type,0,4633762.htmlstory?TypeCode=18">disaster relief</a>)\r\n\r\n<strong>Hack 03: Low-rent data visualization as a novel entry point</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you set up the query string, there\'s no reason that your custom entry point must be an HTML form. My editors wanted to group the charities by their fundraising efficiency and give readers the chance to look at them group by group (i.e. which are the best, average, worst, <em>et cetera</em>.) We could have made a dropdown box, ordered list or sortable table. But the idea Thomas Lauder and I hatched instead was an interactive grid modeled on the <a href="http://mutualfunds.about.com/od/mutualfunds101/fr/stylebox.htm">Morningstar Style Box</a> that sorts charities by the size and efficiency of their fundraising efforts. I built it with <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagemap">an old A List Apart trick</a> so that each square links to the list of charities in its category. Take a look at it <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-home,0,7128706.htmlstory">here</a>. We also made a smaller version, currently on the site\'s frontpage and in a story-level reefer. Here\'s a hideous screenshot to prove it. You\'ll have to go to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-charity6-2008jul06,0,6668563.story">the site</a> if you actually want to play with it.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.palewire.com/images/mini-grid.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nAlright, I\'ve got a few more up my sleeve, but that\'s probably enough for now. Per usual, far be it from me to say that these methods are the only or most efficient way to solutions. They\'re just the ones I got done on deadline. Feel free to tell me where I screwed up, or how I can do it better next time.'

Tribune Company, Clear Channel, McClatchey, et cetera simply could not exist in their present form if that bill hadn\'t passed. And my boss Sam Zell, telling the story of how he and Randy Michaels bonded at Jacor, said as much when he addressed our staff earlier in the year.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that the perceived economic incentives offered by consolidation and cost-cutting opened up by the 1996 dereg might have been too tempting in the short term for media executives to ignore. And why should they invest time and resources online chasing speculative new revenues, when they could clearly see immediate "efficiencies," "synergies," and  other opportunities to increase profits through consolidation? Plus they got the rush of chasing business\' biggest prize: The Deal. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Air-Battle-Control-Americas/dp/143321332X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1216575528&amp;sr=8-2">Eric Klinenberg\'s book</a> has some great reporting on how driven a lot of media execs were in that direction.)\r\n\r\nSo that\'s my long way of saying I\'m interested in what degree the failure of the MSM to invest online was a victim of that opportunity cost.

aS'Five ways your data app can catch the big news hook.'
p547
aS'<strong>01. Practice news-driven development</strong>\r\n\r\nMost data-driven news applications I\'ve encountered follow what I would call The Chicago Crime model, a name lifted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Holovaty">Adrian Holovaty</a>\'s famous site. Steady streams of government-provided data are repurposed into a flexible interface that allows users to compare disparate sources (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">"the mashup"</a>) and easily localize the information so it can provide particulars to a wide body of users (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">"the long tail"</a>).\r\n\r\nIt\'s a brilliant model, the app that launched a 1,000 ships. But it\'s not the only way to get things done.\r\n\r\nIn news terms, where minutes matter, it can still require a relatively long time to do. Especially when it comes to data acquisition. Let\'s face it, if you\'re using government data as your starting point, the idea of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAPy API</a> is laughable. So don\'t get your hopes up. Goofing around with <a href="http://delicious.com/help/api">delicious tags</a> or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr photos</a> is fun, but if you want to do something original from the public sector, they\'re only going to get you so far. You\'re going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)">FOIA\'ing</a>, or, if you\'re lucky, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">scraping</a>. And then you\'re going to be cleaning. Especially if you\'re invested in serving accurate and consistant information. Because if there\'s a government database out there that\'s ready to serve, I\'ve yet to see it.\r\n\r\nAnd there\'s usually not much of a news hook. Look, I appreciate Everyblock and Chicago Crime and that whole style. Hell, I\'ve essentially remodeled my career to emulate them. But when you get down to it, they\'re essentially built around the idea that umpteen little news hooks ("Someone was robbed in my neighborhood," "A liquor store wants to open up on your block.") will add up to something greater than the sum of their parts. That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_news">"hyperlocal"</a> or  "long tail" philosophy, to use the parlance of our time, may ultimately be where a lot of us end up, but blockbuster news is still happening and there\'s no reason all the same tools that made the Chicago Crime successful can\'t be used to cover the hell out of a big story when it breaks.\r\n\r\nI had just such an opportunity last Friday at the L.A. Times. Late in the afternoon, news broke that a commuter train had crashed in the Valley, potentially killing many riders on board. We didn\'t know how many fatalities to expect, nor how long it would take for their identities released. But we knew that our audience was going to want to know, and as soon as possible. The typical newspaper.com way to handle this sort of thing is to publish a simple list, or "blob of text", when it\'s available. And then follow up later with a scattershot of obituaries, usually released as they appear in the paper. But, when you think about it in terms of the <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307/">Holovaty manifesto</a> and the general concept of the Internet, there\'s really no reason that information couldn\'t be better collected and presented as a browsable database application. It\'s a lesson the LA Times learned earlier this year when <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.latimes.com%2Fwardead%2F&amp;ei=IWLSSMDgNImIsAPTs5HhBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmPX42hJtdAzy-E_MApizlUKuCfQ&amp;sig2=9pSonD-GzR_CrPweqiGY9w">our ripoff</a> of Adrian\'s <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/fallen/">Faces of the Fallen</a> concept reinvigorated the way the paper covers military casualties.\r\n\r\nIt meant staying late at work on a Friday night, busting ass most of my weekend, and putting more faith in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached">memcached</a> than most IT people are comfortable with, but the result was that when the government finally did cough up the fatality list we were ready to immediately publish it as a linked database that, over time, has been filled in by further reporting to include greater detail, photos, and more than 1,600 user comments, many of them extremely moving. It\'s a long way from perfect, but it provided some amount of public service, was way ahead of the competition and generated a pretty goodly amount of traffic along the way. The site is called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=9&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.latimes.com%2Fmetrolink-crash%2F&amp;ei=QWPSSPmUG5KmtQPi8sDfBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGq8xaTWFwZuvgW0kHDf-teJBKJQg&amp;sig2=MeFRlF1YPn5r94yYRQcEBw">Chatsworth Metrolink Crash</a>.\r\n\r\nThat\'s all my long way of saying that I think big events matter and that database journalists shouldn\'t be afraid to dive in when they happen. Whether it\'s posting the location of hurricane shelters, letting people know who the hell all those superdelegates are, or connecting survivors following a disaster, there are plenty of obvious opportunities to do our thing. But it\'s not going to happen if we don\'t see taking on big news as an opportunity, anticipate things like the next hot Google search term, or have the capability to deploy very very quickly.\r\n\r\nI\'m a long way from an authority on the whole deal, but I\'m stumbling my way through it. And here are a couple things I\'ve learned along the way.\r\n\r\n<strong>02. Let last year\'s data be your guide.</strong>\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, we released <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/schools/">California Schools Guide</a>, a collection of data about public and private schools across the state, at the very moment the government lifted its embargo on this year\'s scores. I didn\'t have the newsworthy data in hand until less than 24 hours before it would be publicly released. But by developing the site in advance using the previous year\'s data as dummy entries, I was able to pre-script the loading of the 2008 data after only a few minor changes to the code. This meant that we were able to get our product out when the news hook dropped, at the same time as the paper was otherwise promoting <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-scores5-2008sep05,0,2098428,full.story">an investigative story on the topic</a> and the state\'s propaganda arms were blasting its own message ("Things are getting better! Trust us!").\r\n\r\n<strong>03. Don\'t Repeat Yourself, unless it saves you time.</strong>\r\n\r\nLet me be clear. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\'t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> goal of elegence through efficiency is laudable. And, as a guiding principle for development, you probably can\'t get any better. It is the single point of truth. It\'s like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">natural selection</a>, except for awesomeness. But when you\'re on a tight deadline, and you\'ve already got a code implementation that works, sometimes you JDFWI, Just Don\'t Fuck With It. Yeah, so maybe you just copied and pasted and introduced a little redundancy. And maybe your css is just a hodgepodge of div\'s repurposed from other apps. But it works, right? And what\'s more important, trimming down your code base, or getting the news out ahead of your competition?\r\n\r\n<strong>04. Use Django\'s admin to your advantage.</strong>\r\n\r\nFor anyone who\'s already doing this stuff, it probably goes without saying, but <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#ref-contrib-admin">Django\'s admin</a> is really great. As soon as your database models are written, you\'ve instantly got a set of entry forms that are ready to deploy. This is incredibly useful when trying to turn around simple data apps on deadline. For instance, when it came to the Metrolink crash, I was able to get the models and admin up Friday night so that reporters on Metro desk could begin working on entry as I shifted to work on the views and templates.\r\n\r\n<strong>05. Publish now, or perish.</strong>\r\n\r\nYou can have the greatest app in the world, but if you can\'t push it out the web ASAP, you\'re nowhere. If you\'re going the Chicago Crime route, this isn\'t as big of a deal. But if you\'re trying to hit the big news hook, it\'s utterly essential. And treating big news like you would anything else on your "product schedule" or "iteration cycle" just isn\'t going to be good enough. You can call it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a>, you can call it reckless, you can call it news-driven development.'
