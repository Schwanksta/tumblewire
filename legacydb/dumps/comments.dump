They got both and The Saints never really warmed up, except for the two-minute drill at the end of the first half and the insane Reggie Bush catch and run.

If I had to pick, I would have picked the Saints, too. I thought they'd overcome the weather.

Or maybe we shouldn't blame the weather, maybe the Bears are good.

Everyone,

I do not see how a member of the Fourth Estate, dedicated to protecting the First Amendment, can censor what its own employees and partners can see.

I'd add that some beginners, aka me, might be more comfortable with Python string expressions than regexes. Regexes are great, but I still find them difficult to read. I usually don't need the kind of power that they offer, and since I'm used to spreadsheet and database string functions, the Python string functions are familiar.There's a great quote in David Mertz' quietly brilliant "Text Processing in Python""Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know. I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems." -- Jamie Zawinskibestt^

If it helps, <a href="../../05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/" rel="nofollow">the tutorial I put up yesterday</a> has a little more explanation about how to put together a basic regex. The objective here is more focused about pulling the moving parts together than any particular operation, so maybe regexes are too much to bite off if they're going to trip people up.</p>
<p>Do you have any tricks to share with the kids on how they could use "in" or the string module to replace what's up there?</p>^

There's simply not time.My point is, this should be part of the toolkit of any reporter tracking a political figure's attempts to maneuver around an issue.^

<p>I suspect there are two reasons for that.</p>
<p>One is that the data acquisition is very simple. All you need is a big blob of text and you're good to go. That's a lot easier than assembling data for a proper bivariate analysis.</p>
<p>Two is that even if the diagram you produce isn't all that revelatory, it still looks somewhat interesting. At least enough to convince us it merits publication. I think that's at least partially because the form is still somewhat novel. We've all see a line chart a million times, so it probably has to be telling us something pretty dramatic before we get too excited about it.</p>
<p>They're not very pretty, but we've worked a couple quick ones into the LAT lately. Here's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-stateoftheunion-cloud,0,1766520.htmlstory" rel="nofollow">Bush's SOTUs</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/politics/cal/la-stateofthestate-cloud,1,7826923.htmlstory" rel="nofollow">Arnold's SOTS's</a>, and this cycle's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-debatecloud-dem,0,965448.htmlstory" rel="nofollow">Democratic</a> and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-debatecloud-dem,1,366108.htmlstory" rel="nofollow">Republican</a> debates.

$ cd ./nietzsche$ curl -O "http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7{zara,ecce,gbrt,gtzn,jnst,msch}10.txt"
was I bad?
a python basic question:
Do you not have to declare the variable "book"? or variable "line" in that case, like you did with "path", "freddys_library", "file", "hit_count" and "text"

My original command worked on my laptop that runs Mac OS X Tiger, but, now that I try it,  does not work on my other laptop that runs Mac OS Leopard. Is that what you're running? I'm don't know how to explain it. Must be some quirk in how they interpret Unix <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ish" rel="nofollow">"ish."</a> One other hackaround is to try another bit of command-line symbolry.</p>
<p>curl -o nietzsche/#1.txt "http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7{zara,ecce,gbrt,gtzn,jnst,msch}10.txt"</p>
<p>That seemed to work fine for me in Leopard.</p>
<p>You don't actually have to declare "line" or "book." Since each appears in a magic spot in the "for ... in ... :" clause, python automagically gets it going. It's documented further <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/file_handling/for_loops.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

The encoding thing you're talking about is well documented <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is an early experiment with putting code snippets on the blog and I think we've bumped into a bug. Since Python defaults to ASCII encoding, I suppose I should try to find a way to make this easier on folks. I hadn't thought of it, since I personally prefer to retype code from tutorials rather than cut-and-paste, because I have some superstitious belief that it will help me memorize the commands, or at least think a little harder about what the hell they might be doing. I have no real evidence that actually works, but it makes me feel good.</p>

I did it originally on Tiger, but it might the last version of Tiger 10.4.11 or something, maybe that makes a difference. I don't know if it's that dollar sign after "nietzsche/" or it likes a hash wildcard like your new version. I'll give it a try, thanks much!^

I put in some time today dressing up little things on the blog's infrastructure. One thing I tried to do was wrap in the code formatting style you see above. Are the copy and pastes working for you now?^

^93^|^Tom^|^thomas.lauder@gmail.com^|^http://latimes.com^|^24.205.6.53^|^2008-04-15 00:47:31^|^ok, the view code thing kicks ass, looks like javascript only? 

Tried it twice on new <a href="http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/" rel="nofollow">recipe</a>. First, cut-and-pasted formatted text from the blog page, got non-ascii error, halted. Then ran code cut-and-pasted from popup plain text "view code" window, ran great. 

When it comes to copying-and-pasting, does Bash (in Terminal) also care if the text is ascii or utf or iso or whatever?

The whole topper thing brings up a novice recurring question for me: why is python's declaration path:

$ /usr/bin/env python

and not just 

$ /usr/bin/

which has the python files. is env some kind of pointer file that every system has, sort of a preferences file?^
^93^|^Tom^|^thomas.lauder@gmail.com^|^http://latimes.com^|^24.205.6.53^|^2008-04-15 01:35:46^|^interesting trivia: when i cut utf-8 and paste it into the python script as a comment, has no problem. just actual code^
^93^|^Tom^|^thomas.lauder@gmail.com^|^http://latimes.com^|^24.205.6.53^|^2008-04-15 01:42:55^|^ignore that last comment, mixing utf-8 and ascii not a good idea^
^100^|^the gun^|^thomas.lauder@gmail.com^|^^|^24.205.6.53^|^2008-04-15 01:50:08^|^This definitely demonstrates the magnitude of regular expressions. My usual bombardment of QUESTIONS (these may be pretty rudimentary): 

1. If you don't use \w in the regex, will it find anything, including whitespace chars?noticed we didn't use in the shakespeare recipes.

2. "{m,n} - There must be at least m repetitions, and at most n." By just putting the 4 inside {}, does this mean 4 is both m and n? In other words, same as {4,4}

3. still not sure I understand the line variable. Is that some standard keyword or our own created variable. I guess I can't figure out if it knows something is a line since we didn't specify that.

4. Why do we open the regex with an r ? According to that <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000310000000000000000" rel="nofollow">link</a> you gave (great resource!), is it to avoid excape (\) characters?

5. We don't need a closing/lingering comma?^
^93^|^palewire^|^palewire@palewire.com^|^http://www.palewire.com^|^76.87.255.54^|^2008-04-15 08:13:52^|^Okay. I'm not sure I follow, but it sounds like <em>maybe</em> the new code formatting is working for you.

I assume the Mac terminal must have some sort of encoding scheme (Isn't it in the display preferences or something?), but I really don't know how it works. <a href="http://www.rift.dk/news.php?item.7.6" rel="nofollow">These</a> <a href="http://desp.night.pl/terminal.html" rel="nofollow">guys</a> claim to be on top of it, for whatever that's worth.

As far as python's "shebang" goes, you're right, "env" is the home of all your environment variables, which includes the PATH varible that would show the way to your "python" command and interpreter. Try typing "env" into your bash sometime and you'll see what I mean. It also looks like Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable" rel="nofollow">a helpful entry</a> on the topic.

I'm a long way from an expert on this stuff, but I'm sure that on many systems you could happily substitute...

<pre lang="Python">
#!/usr/bin/python</pre>

... or whatever the direct path is to your python interpreter's binary file and it would still work fine. In fact, I bet that, depending on how you execute the file...

<pre lang="Python">
#!python
</pre>

...might even work. 

Frankly, the only reason I use /usr/bin/env is superstition,  it's the convention I was taught when I started. My guess for why it's better: I think it would probably still work if my python installation was not at /usr/bin/python, but still somewhere else on the PATH. If you explictly state the location of python, then I suppose it would probably stop working if you moved to a system where it was someplace else. For example, what if you're running Mac OSX and you install Python or Ruby or whatever using Fink or MacPorts or whatever and it puts it in some weird location.^
^100^|^palewire^|^palewire@palewire.com^|^http://www.palewire.com^|^76.87.255.54^|^2008-04-15 08:52:53^|^1. What happens if you don't include any between the word boundaries? Like "\b\b"? Hmm. I can't think of a situation where you'd find two word boundaries in a row. But I'll never say never when it comes to this stuff. 

2. Yep, you're right. 

3. I don't know all the details on this one, but my understanding is that "for line in" is a tuned up version of earlier Python methods for line-reading, like xreadlines(). As a low-level user, I really don't know what's happening behind the scenes. Here are <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node9.html" rel="nofollow">the basic input and output docs</a>. 

4. You're right, the purpose of prefixing a regular expression with an "r" is to avoid <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000420000000000000000" rel="nofollow"> the "backslash plague"</a>  by using r to switch to "raw string notation." That's necessary here because we're using the "\b" word boundary. As <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000510000000000000000" rel="nofollow">the guide</a> I linked to says:
<blockquote>In Python's string literals, "\b" is the backspace character, ASCII value 8. If you're not using raw strings, then Python will convert the "\b" to a backspace, and your RE won't match as you expect it to. The following example looks the same as our previous RE, but omits the "r" in front of the RE string.</blockquote><pre lang="Python">>>> p = re.compile('\bclass\b')
>>> print p.search('no class at all')
None
>>> print p.search('\b' + 'class' + '\b')  
<re.MatchObject instance at 80c3ee0></pre>

5. I'm not sure what you mean about a "closing/lingering comma." That's a convention I'm unfamilar with, unless you mean the "print hits," style comma I might have used in past recipes. By default, Python's print command will follow whatever it spits out with a newline command "\n" that will kick you down to the next line. But if you stick a comma at the end of your print statements, it will stop doing that.^

^93^|^Tom^|^thomas.lauder@gmail.com^|^^|^24.205.6.53^|^2008-04-15 10:46:42^|^oh, yeah, the code viewer works great, if I cut and paste code from it directly into textmate (editor i'm using), no ascii problems. I did run into some problems when i mixed code from your code viewer with code from web pages, something i shouldn't have done.

thanks for the bash links and the explanation on "env" ...  i'm also a firm believer in superstition, as is our buddy <a href="http://video1.washingtontimes.com/joecurl/2008/04/mccain_triskaidekaphobic_1.html" rel="nofollow">John McCain</a>^

Perhaps the better word choice on my part would be "odd." This isn't a big deal or anything, just a little odd. But I think it must say something about how the world thinks the Web relates to print, I'm just not sure exactly what. And I feel like I'd be smarter if I knew.

Obviously, the Washington Post Company makes money on the deal, which is good for them, but at the same time they're exposing their readers to the competition's product. There's some trade off calculation going on. And maybe the online revenue is so coveted -- or lucrative -- that it's an easy one to make.^

I just thought of something, i've just followed through the recipes for python you have here about searching through text, and i've been downloading all the source text from gutenberg.org.  I just went over to the site to see if there was any other source texts i could play around with, and i realised there was a zipped text version of all the files we have been using.  Whenever its available I try to download compressed versions of files, especially on 'free' projects like gutenberg, as it saves them bandwidth and thus cost.  I'm not sure how much traffic your site gets, but even if its just a little bit you could have cut down on bandwidth used by getting the zip files and unzipping them locally.

(this would involve storing it in a list and checking through them all, right?  I added a little counter to the word prints, and there is 176,189 so that would take a while surely?

^100^|^Ben^|^benpage26@gmail.com^|^^|^147.188.254.98^|^2008-07-03 15:14:54^|^I extended the program to count unique hits only if anyone is interested, or could tell me a more efficient way.  (maybe python has a binary tree module or something?)

[code]
#!/usr/bin/env python

import re

bible = open("kjv10.txt","r")

regex = re.compile(r"\b\w{4}\b")

count = 0
words = []
for line in bible:
 fourletterwords = regex.findall(line) # returns all matches as a list
 for word in fourletterwords:
  for w in words:
   if w == word:
    break
  else:
    words.append(word)
    count = count + 1
    print count, word	

print count, "unique words"

However, I think something like the Metrolink Crash application you did could be re-purposed into a generic "lots of people have died" application.

Side note: we actually built a "lots of people have died" application at ajc.com. Most morbid. Application. Ever.

Because it's reusable we don't have to go into crunch mode when that news happens and our digital staff can spin it up without having to worry about what's on our development plate.

Just my $0.02^
^147^|^palewire^|^palewire@palewire.com^|^http://www.palewire.com^|^76.171.77.248^|^2008-09-18 08:47:54^|^I think that's totally fair, Chris. And when somebody actually introduces me to those ROI numbers, I'll get back to you. Though my fear is that if someone were to actually calc it based on what we currently hop, the answer might be that nothing is worth doing. Maybe I should wait for somebody to come tell me and work on Caspio apps instead. These business people have it all mapped out, right? Or maybe we should put $150 bucks a month up at Media Temple and try some things.

Now that we have it, I think that the Metrolink app can and should be repurposed as a generic app, but you're never going to get there unless you're anticipating these things in the first place.  If you're at a news organization that already has their menu of generic news type applications for everything that comes up, more power to you. You're well ahead of me. And, guess what, I'm already assigned to move onto the next app, so we'll see if that generic long-horizon app thing happens.

But there's also a degree to which news is always going to be unpredictable and if we're not willing to quickly adapt and respond to conditions on the ground, we're going to miss out. When news breaks, reporters work around the clock. And if technical people think they're always going to get off that hook, they better be pretty awesome at anticipating how content works. Build us that CMS and I'll gladly work in it instead. I never signed up to be a computer programmer, that's for sure.^

There's a lot of things newspapers do that make absolutely no business sense. Example: paying someone $20 an hour for four hours to produce a 2 minute video that gets maybe a couple hundred views and brings in $10 in ad revenue.

Fortunately, Ben's bosses have given us <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&amp;aid=150818" rel="nofollow">something to go on</a> to help us answer this ROI question. Short version, 850,000 page views in a few days. I see two ad positions, so call it 1.7 million ad impressions. Let's say the LA Times gets $5 per CPM. If so, Ben's app made $8,500. As richly compensated as Ben no doubt is, I'm willing to bet large amounts of money that his labor costs weren't $8,500. And he produced an app that can be replicated the next time there's a mass casualty news event, and it generated material for the print product.

I think if more projects had ROI like this, we'd all be in a lot better shape.

Awesome work Ben.^
^147^|^Chris Heisel^|^chris@heisel.org^|^http://heisel.org^|^69.94.192.149^|^2008-09-18 19:31:31^|^Ben,

I'm sorry if I sounded disparaging at all of the work you did. That was not, in any way, shape or form, the case. The work is stellar.

I do think it's worth discussing the scalability of "news driven development." I'm not referring to reqs/second or horizontal vs. vertical. For me it's a matter of time scale.

What happens in one month, two months, two years, three years? The code we write lingers on. It's an ecosystem where all our future applications have to live.

If deadline-driven one-off after one-off form a house of cards, the next crunch-time app might not launch on time.

The remedy isn't waterfall or big design up front (shudder) but agile methods and a religious zeal for refactoring and testing :-)

My concern is that the newsroom culture, which is where I was born and raised (copy editor/designer by trade), doesn't really appreciate or allocate time for foundational or sustainable work. It's always about the next big thing, the next days paper, etc.

I'm all for competiting on the basis of speed (What Would Mary Poppendieck Do is my mantra), but if the development effort isn't sustainable it's for naught.^
^147^|^palewire^|^palewire@palewire.com^|^http://www.palewire.com^|^72.220.167.26^|^2008-09-19 00:56:36^|^Hey Chris, you don't have to worry about riling me up. I didn't take anything personal. I appreciate the criticism and I was just trying to sort of throw my hands up in the air over the ROI thing, not be upset with you for raising it. If I failed to communicate well, that's on me.

But, anyway, I think your criticisms are on point and well taken. My objective here isn't to criticize agile methods as a general practice, but to suggest that there are going to be some occasions where you just have to tear up the rule book and get things done ASAP. I wouldn't want to recommend that as any sort of day to day practice, just as I wouldn't like see earthquakes or terrorist attacks or any of the other random events that might require such rush jobs happen every day. But, like it or not, big news we don't expect is going to happen. And I think we've got to be ready and willing to do something about it.^
^147^|^Ken Schwencke^|^schwanksta.site@gmail.com^|^http://schwanksta.com^|^209.251.131.162^|^2008-09-21 19:27:27^|^First off, awesome app. It's exactly the type of stuff I want to get us doing at the Alligator. I did have a question, though: what was so memchached-intensive? Were you just working on a server with limited resources?

Furthering the conversation you're having here though, I see this kind of deadline app-writing as a necessary evil until you can refactor the code into something a bit more reusable. At the least, it should be the catalyst to write some more extensible code while there are no major accidents demanding databases.

As for the ROI, I'm with Matt Waite...I'll bet more people visited this -- and found it useful -- than a video.^
^147^|^palewire^|^palewire@palewire.com^|^http://www.palewire.com^|^71.182.164.118^|^2008-09-21 19:37:02^|^Ken, you're on point. There's nothing in the app that's all that database intensive. There are a small number of records, few joins and a tad bit of writing with the user comments. The "faith in memcached" reference was more shorthand for the small amount of stress testing and pre-launch analysis that happens before this sort of launch, due to the desire to publish as quickly as possible. That's surely one of the risky parts.

And, you're right, this stuff should be rolled forward and refactored into something more generic and secure. My main point is that we need to get off our duff if we want to catch some news hooks. Because the opportunities are out there, but if we sit around waiting for conventional IT behavior and our CMS "solutions" to catch up, we might never get there. Or somebody else will be there first. We have the technology, we can break news.

This video thing you guys are highlight interests me. Are there people writing elsewhere on the web about the current ROI and/or long-term outlook for different approaches (YouTube style vs. NYT style, for instance).^
