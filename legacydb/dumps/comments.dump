They got both and The Saints never really warmed up, except for the two-minute drill at the end of the first half and the insane Reggie Bush catch and run. Other than those two bursts of excitement for the Saints, they were destroyed by the Bears.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick, I would have picked the Saints, too. I thought they'd overcome the weather.\r\n\r\nOr maybe we shouldn't blame the weather, maybe the Bears are good.\r\n\r\nThe Colts have been my AFC team since 1994 (Rams in the NFC, of course).

Regexes are great, but I still find them difficult to read. I usually don\'t need the kind of power that they offer, and since I\'m used to spreadsheet and database string functions, the Python string functions are familiar.There\'s a great quote in David Mertz\' quietly brilliant "Text Processing in Python""Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know. I\'ll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems." -- Jamie Zawinskibestt'

aS'Okay. I\'m not sure I follow, but it sounds like <em>maybe</em> the new code formatting is working for you.\r\n\r\nI assume the Mac terminal must have some sort of encoding scheme (Isn\'t it in the display preferences or something?), but I really don\'t know how it works. <a href="http://www.rift.dk/news.php?item.7.6" rel="nofollow">These</a> <a href="http://desp.night.pl/terminal.html" rel="nofollow">guys</a> claim to be on top of it, for whatever that\'s worth.\r\n\r\nAs far as python\'s "shebang" goes, you\'re right, "env" is the home of all your environment variables, which includes the PATH varible that would show the way to your "python" command and interpreter. Try typing "env" into your bash sometime and you\'ll see what I mean. It also looks like Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable" rel="nofollow">a helpful entry</a> on the topic.\r\n\r\nI\'m a long way from an expert on this stuff, but I\'m sure that on many systems you could happily substitute...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">\r\n#!/usr/bin/python</pre>\r\n\r\n... or whatever the direct path is to your python interpreter\'s binary file and it would still work fine. In fact, I bet that, depending on how you execute the file...\r\n\r\n<pre lang="Python">\r\n#!python\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n...might even work. \r\n\r\nFrankly, the only reason I use /usr/bin/env is superstition,  it\'s the convention I was taught when I started. My guess for why it\'s better: I think it would probably still work if my python installation was not at /usr/bin/python, but still somewhere else on the PATH. If you explictly state the location of python, then I suppose it would probably stop working if you moved to a system where it was someplace else. For example, what if you\'re running Mac OSX and you install Python or Ruby or whatever using Fink or MacPorts or whatever and it puts it in some weird location.'

aS'1. What happens if you don\'t include any between the word boundaries? Like "\\b\\b"? Hmm. I can\'t think of a situation where you\'d find two word boundaries in a row. But I\'ll never say never when it comes to this stuff. \r\n\r\n2. Yep, you\'re right. \r\n\r\n3. I don\'t know all the details on this one, but my understanding is that "for line in" is a tuned up version of earlier Python methods for line-reading, like xreadlines(). As a low-level user, I really don\'t know what\'s happening behind the scenes. Here are <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node9.html" rel="nofollow">the basic input and output docs</a>. \r\n\r\n4. You\'re right, the purpose of prefixing a regular expression with an "r" is to avoid <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000420000000000000000" rel="nofollow"> the "backslash plague"</a>  by using r to switch to "raw string notation." That\'s necessary here because we\'re using the "\\b" word boundary. As <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000510000000000000000" rel="nofollow">the guide</a> I linked to says:\r\n<blockquote>In Python\'s string literals, "\\b" is the backspace character, ASCII value 8. If you\'re not using raw strings, then Python will convert the "\\b" to a backspace, and your RE won\'t match as you expect it to. The following example looks the same as our previous RE, but omits the "r" in front of the RE string.</blockquote><pre lang="Python">>>> p = re.compile(\'\\bclass\\b\')\r\n>>> print p.search(\'no class at all\')\r\nNone\r\n>>> print p.search(\'\\b\' + \'class\' + \'\\b\')  \r\n<re.MatchObject instance at 80c3ee0></pre>\r\n\r\n5. I\'m not sure what you mean about a "closing/lingering comma." That\'s a convention I\'m unfamilar with, unless you mean the "print hits," style comma I might have used in past recipes. By default, Python\'s print command will follow whatever it spits out with a newline command "\\n" that will kick you down to the next line. But if you stick a comma at the end of your print statements, it will stop doing that.'

But I think it must say something about how the world thinks the Web relates to print, I\'m just not sure exactly what. And I feel like I\'d be smarter if I knew.\r\n\r\nObviously, the Washington Post Company makes money on the deal, which is good for them, but at the same time they\'re exposing their readers to the competition\'s product. There\'s some trade off calculation going on. And maybe the online revenue is so coveted -- or lucrative -- that it\'s an easy one to make.'

I just went over to the site to see if there was any other source texts i could play around with, and i realised there was a zipped text version of all the files we have been using.  Whenever its available I try to download compressed versions of files, especially on 'free' projects like gutenberg, as it saves them bandwidth and thus cost.  I'm not sure how much traffic your site gets, but even if its just a little bit you could have cut down on bandwidth used by getting the zip files and unzipping them locally.  It would also give you an excuse to show people how to batch unzip files from CLI."

aS'Ben, I can definitely see the appeal of "news driven development" but (and I\'ll be that guy) I\'d have to ask about the ROI on it... how much work for how much return in audience/page views/revenue?\r\n\r\nHowever, I think something like the Metrolink Crash application you did could be re-purposed into a generic "lots of people have died" application.\r\n\r\nSide note: we actually built a "lots of people have died" application at ajc.com. Most morbid. Application. Ever.\r\n\r\nBecause it\'s reusable we don\'t have to go into crunch mode when that news happens and our digital staff can spin it up without having to worry about what\'s on our development plate.\r\n\r\nJust my $0.02'

aS"I think that's totally fair, Chris. And when somebody actually introduces me to those ROI numbers, I'll get back to you. Though my fear is that if someone were to actually calc it based on what we currently hop, the answer might be that nothing is worth doing. Maybe I should wait for somebody to come tell me and work on Caspio apps instead. These business people have it all mapped out, right? Or maybe we should put $150 bucks a month up at Media Temple and try some things.\r\n\r\nNow that we have it, I think that the Metrolink app can and should be repurposed as a generic app, but you're never going to get there unless you're anticipating these things in the first place.  If you're at a news organization that already has their menu of generic news type applications for everything that comes up, more power to you. You're well ahead of me. And, guess what, I'm already assigned to move onto the next app, so we'll see if that generic long-horizon app thing happens.\r\n\r\nBut there's also a degree to which news is always going to be unpredictable and if we're not willing to quickly adapt and respond to conditions on the ground, we're going to miss out. When news breaks, reporters work around the clock. And if technical people think they're always going to get off that hook, they better be pretty awesome at anticipating how content works. Build us that CMS and I'll gladly work in it instead. I never signed up to be a computer programmer, that's for sure."

aS'Chris: I\'m with you on the ROI argument in a lot of ways. There\'s a lot of things newspapers do that make absolutely no business sense. Example: paying someone $20 an hour for four hours to produce a 2 minute video that gets maybe a couple hundred views and brings in $10 in ad revenue.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Ben\'s bosses have given us <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&amp;aid=150818" rel="nofollow">something to go on</a> to help us answer this ROI question. Short version, 850,000 page views in a few days. I see two ad positions, so call it 1.7 million ad impressions. Let\'s say the LA Times gets $5 per CPM. If so, Ben\'s app made $8,500. As richly compensated as Ben no doubt is, I\'m willing to bet large amounts of money that his labor costs weren\'t $8,500. And he produced an app that can be replicated the next time there\'s a mass casualty news event, and it generated material for the print product.\r\n\r\nI think if more projects had ROI like this, we\'d all be in a lot better shape.\r\n\r\nAwesome work Ben.'

aS'Ben,\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry if I sounded disparaging at all of the work you did. That was not, in any way, shape or form, the case. The work is stellar.\r\n\r\nI do think it\'s worth discussing the scalability of "news driven development." I\'m not referring to reqs/second or horizontal vs. vertical. For me it\'s a matter of time scale.\r\n\r\nWhat happens in one month, two months, two years, three years? The code we write lingers on. It\'s an ecosystem where all our future applications have to live.\r\n\r\nIf deadline-driven one-off after one-off form a house of cards, the next crunch-time app might not launch on time.\r\n\r\nThe remedy isn\'t waterfall or big design up front (shudder) but agile methods and a religious zeal for refactoring and testing :-)\r\n\r\nMy concern is that the newsroom culture, which is where I was born and raised (copy editor/designer by trade), doesn\'t really appreciate or allocate time for foundational or sustainable work. It\'s always about the next big thing, the next days paper, etc.\r\n\r\nI\'m all for competiting on the basis of speed (What Would Mary Poppendieck Do is my mantra), but if the development effort isn\'t sustainable it\'s for naught.'

aS"Hey Chris, you don't have to worry about riling me up. I didn't take anything personal. I appreciate the criticism and I was just trying to sort of throw my hands up in the air over the ROI thing, not be upset with you for raising it. If I failed to communicate well, that's on me.\r\n\r\nBut, anyway, I think your criticisms are on point and well taken. My objective here isn't to criticize agile methods as a general practice, but to suggest that there are going to be some occasions where you just have to tear up the rule book and get things done ASAP. I wouldn't want to recommend that as any sort of day to day practice, just as I wouldn't like see earthquakes or terrorist attacks or any of the other random events that might require such rush jobs happen every day. But, like it or not, big news we don't expect is going to happen. And I think we've got to be ready and willing to do something about it."

aS"First off, awesome app. It's exactly the type of stuff I want to get us doing at the Alligator. I did have a question, though: what was so memchached-intensive? Were you just working on a server with limited resources?\r\n\r\nFurthering the conversation you're having here though, I see this kind of deadline app-writing as a necessary evil until you can refactor the code into something a bit more reusable. At the least, it should be the catalyst to write some more extensible code while there are no major accidents demanding databases.\r\n\r\nAs for the ROI, I'm with Matt Waite...I'll bet more people visited this -- and found it useful -- than a video."

aS'Ken, you\'re on point. There\'s nothing in the app that\'s all that database intensive. There are a small number of records, few joins and a tad bit of writing with the user comments. The "faith in memcached" reference was more shorthand for the small amount of stress testing and pre-launch analysis that happens before this sort of launch, due to the desire to publish as quickly as possible. That\'s surely one of the risky parts.\r\n\r\nAnd, you\'re right, this stuff should be rolled forward and refactored into something more generic and secure. My main point is that we need to get off our duff if we want to catch some news hooks. Because the opportunities are out there, but if we sit around waiting for conventional IT behavior and our CMS "solutions" to catch up, we might never get there. Or somebody else will be there first. We have the technology, we can break news.\r\n\r\nThis video thing you guys are highlight interests me. Are there people writing elsewhere on the web about the current ROI and/or long-term outlook for different approaches (YouTube style vs. NYT style, for instance).'
