This is a fork of a blogging system built by my coworker, Ben Welsh. I've been tinkering with doing the same tumblog-style unified site on my own time recently, but I'm a sucker for a clean, existing codebase to start with. This might run my own site soon enough.

The current edition of my blog, published at "palewire.com":http://www.palewire.com.

It's a combination of "coltrane":http://github.com/clones/django-coltrane/tree/master, "jellyroll":http://github.com/jacobian/jellyroll/tree/master and a number of other Django blogs floating around.
